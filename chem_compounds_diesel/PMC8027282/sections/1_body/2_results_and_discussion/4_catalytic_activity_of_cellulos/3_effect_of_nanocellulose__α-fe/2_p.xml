<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0125">The fibrous and porous structure of nanocellulose allowed &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> to be embedded and evenly spread on the pore surface, which resulted in enhanced catalytic activity. Herein, we investigated the effect of the nanocellulose: &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> mass ratio (<italic>r</italic>) on (i) biodiesel yield after 3 h, (ii) the highest attainable biodiesel yield, and (iii) the time needed to obtain this maximal yield (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;8</xref>). At a fixed reaction time of 3 h with the bar chart in grey color, the yield increased with increasing r, equaling 35.00, 70.50, 92.50, and 92.50% at r = 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1, respectively. This shows that at r = 2:1, all nanocellulose pores were filled with &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles as active sites, which resulted in efficient biodiesel production. To observe the mass ratio effect to the reaction rate by extending the time indicated by a black bar chart and red line is the reaction time so that the perfect reaction is achieved. When the reaction time was extended, the maximal yields for r = 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1, equaling 90,00, 90.50, 92.50 and 92.50%, respectively. Therefore, the catalyst with r = 2:1 was concluded to be optimal condition for this esterification reaction.<fig id="fig8"><label>Figure&#160;8</label><caption><p>Effect of nanocellulose to &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> mass ratio on percent yield and reaction time.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0045">Figure&#160;8</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr8"/></fig></p>
