<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0130">Next, we probed the effect of catalyst type on (i) biodiesel yield after 3 h, (ii) the highest attainable biodiesel yield, and (iii) the time needed to obtain this maximal yield (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;9</xref>). At a fixed time of 3 h with the bar chart in dark blue color, &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub>, and cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> (<italic>r</italic> = 2:1) achieved yields of 30.00, 51.50, 86.80, and 92.50%, respectively. The fact that pure ZrO<sub>2</sub> achieved a greater yield than &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> means that the former oxide provided more important active sites than &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The fact that the highest yield was observed for cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> was ascribed to the synergetic effects arising upon the hybridization of the biopolymer with inorganic nanoparticles [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, we also observed the effect of catalyst type to the reaction rate by extending the time indicated by light green the bar chart and red line is the reaction time so that the perfect reaction is achieved. When the reaction time was extended, &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub>, and cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> achieved maximal yields of 92.50% after 7, 5, 4, and 3 h, respectively. Therefore, the cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite is the best suited for the studied esterification reaction, owing to the existence of both acidic and basic sites, besides the presence of pores and large BET surface area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref>) to accommodate the reactants and activate the reaction. Briefly, our explanation for the catalytic activity of the cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst in the reaction by eliminating protons from methanols which attacked the carboxylic group of acids to form an activated complex which is adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and a reaction occurs then the desorption process forms methyl esters product (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;10</xref>).<fig id="fig9"><label>Figure&#160;9</label><caption><p>Effect of type catalyst on percent yield and reaction time.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0050">Figure&#160;9</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr9"/></fig><fig id="fig10"><label>Figure&#160;10</label><caption><p>Proposed reaction mechanism for the esterification of lauric acid over the cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0055">Figure&#160;10</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr10"/></fig></p>
