Decreasing of the product may be caused by deactivation of catalysts by product species adsorption and the unreacted lauric acid onto the surface of catalysts that could block the active sites [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].<fig id="fig11"><label>Figure&#160;11</label><caption><p>Nanocomposite reusability.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0060">Figure&#160;11</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr11"/></fig></p>
