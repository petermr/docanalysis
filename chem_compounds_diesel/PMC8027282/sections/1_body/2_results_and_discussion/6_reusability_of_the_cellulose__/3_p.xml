Thus, we tested the catalytic heterogeneity of the reaction by gravimetry. The results of these studies showed that the weight of catalyst reused after five cycles is obtained constant (initial weight of 0.2 g for the first cycle until after the fifth cycle remains 0.2 g). These results demonstrated that the catalytic system behave a heterogeneous.</p>
