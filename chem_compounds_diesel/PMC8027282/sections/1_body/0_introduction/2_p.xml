Biomass-derived biopolymers play an important role in the mitigation of fossil fuel depletion and global warming caused by the use of synthetic polymers [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a representative sustainable biopolymer, cellulose features high natural abundance, belonging to the green support group [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and can be isolated from rice straw (among other sources), which is an abundant, cheap, and green material that is generated in large quantities as a byproduct of rice production [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and has a high cellulose content [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
