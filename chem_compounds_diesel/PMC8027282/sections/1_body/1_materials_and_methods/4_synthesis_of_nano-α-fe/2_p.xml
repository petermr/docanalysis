FeCl<sub>2</sub>&#183;4H<sub>2</sub>O and FeCl<sub>3</sub>&#183;6H<sub>2</sub>O were separately dissolved in distilled water to concentrations of 2 M and 1 M, respectively, and the respective solutions were mixed in a 2:3 (v/v) ratio. The mixture was slowly supplemented with 2 M NH<sub>4</sub>OH to reach a pH of 10 and vigorously stirred for 2 h. The brown precipitate was separated, rinsed with distilled water and ethanol, dried at 60 &#176;C overnight, and calcined at 600 &#176;C for 1 h.</p>
