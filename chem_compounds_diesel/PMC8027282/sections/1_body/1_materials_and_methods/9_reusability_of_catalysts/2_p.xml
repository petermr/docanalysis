The catalyst was separated and washed several times with hot ethanol and then hexane to remove the residual of lauric acid and product which adsorbed on the catalyst surface, and then dried in an oven at 100 &#176;C for 12 h. To observe the leaching of the catalyst species into the reaction medium causes contamination of the final product and so lead to a decrease in catalyst activity [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]We tested the nanocomposite weight of reused catalysts after each cycle were measured by gravimetry to confirm the quantity of catalyst leached and to confirm the catalytic system behave a heterogeneous.</p>
