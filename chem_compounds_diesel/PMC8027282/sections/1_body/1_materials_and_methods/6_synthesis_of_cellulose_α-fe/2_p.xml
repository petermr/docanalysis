<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0060">The first stage, &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> composites were prepared as described elsewhere [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was added to a solution containing H<sub>2</sub>O, ethanol, and ammonia, and the mixture was ultrasonicated to form a homogeneous suspension. The resulting dispersion was slowly supplemented with ZrOCl<sub>2</sub>&#183;8H<sub>2</sub>O and stirred for 6 h. The precipitate was separated, sequentially rinsed with ethanol and water, and oven-dried at 60 &#176;C for 12 h to afford &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub>. In the second stage, cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites were prepared using a slight modification of a previously reported method [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, nanocellulose was homogenously dispersed in an aqueous solution of NaOH and urea at &#8722;4 &#176;C, the solution was supplemented with a dispersion of &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> in aqueous NaOH, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 6 h. The product was separated, sequentially rinsed with ethanol and water, and dried. The resulting cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites were characterized by FTIR, XRD, BET, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>
