<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0155">Herein, we report a nanocomposite derived from rice straw cellulose embedded hematite, and zirconia as a heterogeneous green catalyst for the highly efficient synthesis of biodiesel through the esterification of lauric acid with methanol. This catalyst was shown to comprise porous and irregularly shaped &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> particles evenly distributed in the nanocellulose support. The presence of nanocellulose was important role for improving high catalytic activity for biodiesel production. The optimal cellulose@&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite (nanocellulose:&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#8211;ZrO<sub>2</sub> mass ratio = 2:1) achieved a biodiesel yield of 92.50%, and the properties of the obtained biodiesel were close to those stipulated by international standards. Moreover, the developed catalyst could be reused for five times without any significant activity loss.</p>
