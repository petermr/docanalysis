Moreover, biodiesel production from microalgae mainly depends on the availability of biomass and scale-up process that needs optimization, to reduce cost (Decostere et al. 2013). The kinetics deals with how the rate of the reaction is dependent on the concentration of the reactants. For the cells to multiply and grow, a certain amount of substrate and other required components from the production medium is consumed (Rao 2005). Kinetic models serves in designing a bioreactor, controlling the microbial processes and predicting the behavior of the processes more easily than laboratory experiments (Bailley and Ollis 1986). To learn the dynamics of biomass growth and lipid production by microalgae, suitable kinetic modeling has to be developed for predicting the performance and optimization of photobioreactor operating conditions (Galvao et al. 2013).

Regulation of lipid synthesis in microalgae may be a means by which energy can be spent during stressed conditions, helping to maintain a safe turnover rate of the ATP and reductant pools sustained by the light reactions. Fatty acid production is expensive in terms of ATP and reductant requirements (Xiong et al. 2010). Intracellular lipid storage in microalgae produce significantly more energy than carbohydrates: 37 and 17 kJ/g, respectively; and, on a per-mass basis, lipid synthesis requires twice the reducing energy (NADPH) than carbohydrate or protein synthesis (Hu et al. 2008).

249,D:\main_projects\repositories\docanalysis\chem_compounds_diesel\PMC5040861\sections\1_body\0_introduction\2_p.xml,"As a short term measure, use of biodiesel blends with diesel appears to be a good option among encouraging the switch over to alternative fuels in general and biofuels in particular 1, 2, 3, 4. One major worry has been that without tax breaks, replacing diesel with biodiesel blends is not possible 5, 6. At present, biodiesel blends sold at petrol pumps in various countries is made by chemical catalyst route.

TLL happens to be among the least expensive commercially available lipases. We have reported earlier that precipitation rather than lyophilization is a better strategy for “drying” (removal of bulk water) enzymes before these are placed in organic solvents 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Such precipitates have been called enzyme precipitated and rinsed with propanol (EPRP) or more generally enzyme precipitated and rinsed with organic solvents (EPROS). The use of surfactants is known to activate lipases by opening of the ‘lid’ on the active site 21, 22. Our approach is similar to the one described by earlier workers 23, 24, 25 wherein the enzyme was dried by lyophilization. In the current work the drying has been done by precipitation. In both approaches the dried enzyme has a highly rigid conformation which results in freezing the “induced conformation”. Recently, we have shown that EPROS of subtilisin prepared by precipitation with a substrate alcohol bioimprints the enzyme and increases its rate 20. The dual bioimprinting by incorporating an ester substrate could enhance the reaction rates even further 20. The dual bioimprinting strategy in the present instance consists of precipitating the lipase with a substrate alcohol in the presence of a surfactant. This led to a preparation imprinted with a substrate but in the open lid form. We also use a solvent free medium (the oil itself works as a reaction media and no additional organic solvent is added).

The use of surfactants is known to activate lipases by opening of the ‘lid’ on the active site 21, 22. Our approach is similar to the one described by earlier workers 23, 24, 25 wherein the enzyme was dried by lyophilization. In the current work the drying has been done by precipitation. In both approaches the dried enzyme has a highly rigid conformation which results in freezing the “induced conformation”. Recently, we have shown that EPROS of subtilisin prepared by precipitation with a substrate alcohol bioimprints the enzyme and increases its rate 20. The dual bioimprinting by incorporating an ester substrate could enhance the reaction rates even further 20. The dual bioimprinting strategy in the present instance consists of precipitating the lipase with a substrate alcohol in the presence of a surfactant. This led to a preparation imprinted with a substrate but in the open lid form. We also use a solvent free medium (the oil itself works as a reaction media and no additional organic solvent is added). This further reduces the cost and removes another “non green” component from the process.","Recently, we have shown that EPROS of subtilisin prepared by precipitation with a substrate alcohol bioimprints the enzyme and increases its rate 20.","EPROS, subtilisin, prepared, precipitation, substrate, alcohol bioimprints, enzyme, increases, rate","ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY","29, 38, 49, 61, 82, 92, 116, 127, 141","34, 48, 57, 74, 91, 111, 122, 136, 145",,,,

Moreover, microwave irradiation could also accelerate desorption of noncovalent enzyme molecules from the support surface after successive cycles of reaction.","Thus, a strong energy transfer and heating of nonreacted ethanol molecules could increase the interaction with the essential hydration layer surrounding the enzyme structure, thus leading to possible distortion of its active conformation.","energy transfer, heating, ethanol, molecules, increase, interaction, essential, hydration, enzyme structure, distortion, active conformation","ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY","15, 35, 57, 65, 81, 94, 115, 125, 157, 200, 218","30, 42, 64, 74, 89, 105, 124, 134, 173, 210, 237",,,,

Some insight into the reason for lower operational stability under microwave irradiation may be gained by considering the medium polarity. Microwave irradiation exerts a strong selective heating by highly polar compounds (e.g., short-chain alcohols) due to their low log P values and high dielectric constant that affect the dipole molecular rotation and ion induction of these compounds, thus improving the energy transfer in the reaction mixture 54, 57.

Oleic acid was used as a model substrate to optimize of reaction conditions (Fig. 4). Initially, one gram of oleic acid was treated with 100 mg of Sg-CN in methanol at room temperature (Table 1, entry 1) and the reaction was monitored using GC-MS at regular time intervals of time. Complete conversion of oleic acid to the corresponding methyl ester occurred within 4 hours. The most enthusing observation was the product purity attained after a simple decantation and distillation of reaction mixture. Experiments were conducted then to determine the optimum catalyst charge required for this efficient fatty acid esterification. Accordingly, oleic acid was treated with 75 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg, 10 mg and 5 mg of Sg-CN (Table 1, entries 2–5).

Oleic acid was used as a model substrate to optimize of reaction conditions (Fig. 4). Initially, one gram of oleic acid was treated with 100 mg of Sg-CN in methanol at room temperature (Table 1, entry 1) and the reaction was monitored using GC-MS at regular time intervals of time. Complete conversion of oleic acid to the corresponding methyl ester occurred within 4 hours. The most enthusing observation was the product purity attained after a simple decantation and distillation of reaction mixture. Experiments were conducted then to determine the optimum catalyst charge required for this efficient fatty acid esterification. Accordingly, oleic acid was treated with 75 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg, 10 mg and 5 mg of Sg-CN (Table 1, entries 2–5). Complete conversion of oleic acid to methyl oleate was discerned again (Table 1, entries 2–4) whereas the reaction with 10 mg of Sg-CN required overnight stirring for the completion of esterification at room temperature. However, further reduction in Sg-CN quantity does not allow the reaction to be completed even after 24 hours of stirring (Table 1, entry 6).

Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is the most popular SCF because of its relatively low critical parameters, low toxicity and non-flammability; furthermore, it is chemically inert under most conditions, has good solvent properties for non-polar solutes, and is considered as a green solvent. Carbon dioxide is clearly a “greenhouse gas”; however, it is massively produced as a by-product at industrial scale (e.g., in ammonia plants), and it is therefore cheap.

Lipases and esterases in scCO2 are the most widely studied systems, due to the catalytic promiscuity of these enzymes towards hydrophobic substrates and the ability of this SCF to dissolve and transport hydrophobic compounds 19. The synthesis of aliphatic esters of different alkyl chain lengths by esterification and/or transesterification (e.g., by alcoholysis, acidolysis or inter-esterification) is a common approach to the production of terpenic flavour compounds (e.g., geranyl acetate) 20, and the valorisation of oils and fats (e.g., enrichment of acylglycerols with polyunsaturated fatty acids 21).

In the same context, for the pressure range of 7.7 to 8.5 MPa, the changes in the conformation of lipase resulted in an increased rate of esterification reactions. Thus, Dhake et al. obtained good yields (up to 99%) for the enzymatic synthesis of several citronellyl esters at 45 °C and 8.0 MPa 31. Temperature influences enzyme activity much more than pressure not only due to the usual increment in reaction rates at higher temperatures, but also because of enzyme thermodeactivation processes. The optimal temperature of enzymatic processes in SCFs is related with pressure as both control solvent properties 29. Water concentration also greatly influences enzyme activity because proteins require a specific amount of bound water molecules to be active. When the water content is too high or if the water is a product of the reaction in the supercritical medium, the resulting increased humidity may lead to enzyme deactivation. Thus, the actual amount of water needed is specific to each SCF-substrate-enzyme system, and must be maintained constant throughout the process 32.

It was found that although all fatty acid methyl esters, including the poly-unsaturated ones, are stable at low temperatures and pressures, but they partially decomposed with isomerization from cis-olefin to trans-olefin at high pressure and temperature. From these results, it was suggested that, for high-quality biodiesel production, the reaction temperatures in SCFs processes should be maintained below 300 °C, preferably at 270 °C for supercritical methanol (scMeOH), and lower than 360 °C for supercritical methyl acetate (scMeOAc) with a supercritical pressure higher than 8.09 MPa (see Figure 3). Besides, higher temperatures increase energy consumption and thus operating costs. However, it has been suggested that by selecting the adequate experimental conditions, processing could use less energy than the conventional method.

Furthermore, reduced dielectric constant may even lead to a single oil/alcohol phase, increasing the reaction rate 50. These facts explain the differences observed when the reaction is performed either under sub-critical or supercritical conditions since the reaction kinetics is highly dependent on the homogeneity of the reaction mixture.

The solubility of reactants and transesterification products (homogeneous or heterogeneous) in the alcohol under various pressure-temperature-molar fraction (P-T-x) conditions is a keystone for rapid and complete tranesterification reactions 42. Liquid-vapor-SC phase transitions for the binary/ternary systems (soybean oil and alcohol at different oil:ethanol molar ratio) were studied by Anitescu et al using a view cell attached to the outlet of the reactor, which was heated from 26 °C to 400 °C at constant volume/density 52. With two liquid phases in ambient conditions, the system showed increasing homogeneity with increasing temperature and pressure until a single SC phase was reached. Under these conditions, the conversion of triglyceride to FAMEs was very rapid compared to that observed under subcritical conditions 53,54. The reaction in continuous flow conditions yields above 98% conversion, with a single clear phase at moderate pressures (10–20 MPa), high temperatures (375–400 °C), low methanol ratios (3:1–6:1) and short reaction times (<3 min). These results are in contrast with those reported by Brignole and co-workers, who observed that high conversion can be obtained, in most cases, even when operating in the two-phase region 55. In this case, the oil transesterification could mainly occur in the light supercritical phase, where the oil and the monoglycerides and diglycerides are partially soluble and the concentration of methanol is high. Moreover, the light-phase transport properties favour a higher reaction rate. The increased methanol/oil ratio leads to a homogeneous supercritical phase by increasing the system temperature while working at moderate pressures of 10–15 MPa, since an increase in the methanol/oil ratio decreases the critical temperature of the system 56,57. Although a high methanol ratio favours the formation of a homogeneous supercritical phase while also driving the reaction to completion, it also increases costs and energy consumption.

The supercritical methyl acetate (scMeOAc) non-catalytic method converts triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and triacetin, instead of glycerol. Furthermore, it has been discovered that there were no adverse effects on the main fuel characteristics when the molar ratio of methyl oleate to triacetin was 3:1, which corresponds to the theoretically derived mole ratio from the trans-esterification reaction of rapeseed oil with methyl acetate (see Figure 4). Moreover, the addition of triacetin to methyl oleate improved the pour point (defined as the lowest temperature at which a fuel product will begin to flow), and triacetin has a high oxidation stability. Therefore, by defining biodiesel fuel as a mixture of methyl oleate and triacetin, the supercritical methyl acetate can lead to an improved yield (105%) of biodiesel fuel compared with the conventional process. However, this value is lower than the maximum recovery expected (125% yield) because of the breakdown at the required high temperatures of some unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters. Despite this, the scMeOAc method not only improves the quality of the biodiesel fuel but also minimizes the separation and purification steps, and therefore the energy required. Saka et al. 70 have used various supercritical carboxylate esters to convert triglycerides into FAMEs and triacetin in the absence of any catalyst. The highest product yield was obtained with supercritical methyl acetate, 97.7 wt% considering a mixture of both FAMEs and triacetin as biodiesel fuel. The lower reactivity shown by other carboxylate esters seems to be related to the length of alkyl chains in the esters, e.g., the longer alkyl chains in both alcohol and acyl moieties of carboxylate esters provides the lowest product yields 71. Banchero and co-workers 72 demonstrated that supercritical methyl acetate can be successfully used in the transesterification process of different vegetable oils to obtain biodiesel fuel. The process was suitable for edible, non-edible or waste oils, regardless of the FFA content which usually affects the conventional transesterification process at atmospheric pressure.

The supercritical methyl acetate (scMeOAc) non-catalytic method converts triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and triacetin, instead of glycerol. Furthermore, it has been discovered that there were no adverse effects on the main fuel characteristics when the molar ratio of methyl oleate to triacetin was 3:1, which corresponds to the theoretically derived mole ratio from the trans-esterification reaction of rapeseed oil with methyl acetate (see Figure 4). Moreover, the addition of triacetin to methyl oleate improved the pour point (defined as the lowest temperature at which a fuel product will begin to flow), and triacetin has a high oxidation stability. Therefore, by defining biodiesel fuel as a mixture of methyl oleate and triacetin, the supercritical methyl acetate can lead to an improved yield (105%) of biodiesel fuel compared with the conventional process. However, this value is lower than the maximum recovery expected (125% yield) because of the breakdown at the required high temperatures of some unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters.

The supercritical methyl acetate (scMeOAc) non-catalytic method converts triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and triacetin, instead of glycerol. Furthermore, it has been discovered that there were no adverse effects on the main fuel characteristics when the molar ratio of methyl oleate to triacetin was 3:1, which corresponds to the theoretically derived mole ratio from the trans-esterification reaction of rapeseed oil with methyl acetate (see Figure 4). Moreover, the addition of triacetin to methyl oleate improved the pour point (defined as the lowest temperature at which a fuel product will begin to flow), and triacetin has a high oxidation stability. Therefore, by defining biodiesel fuel as a mixture of methyl oleate and triacetin, the supercritical methyl acetate can lead to an improved yield (105%) of biodiesel fuel compared with the conventional process. However, this value is lower than the maximum recovery expected (125% yield) because of the breakdown at the required high temperatures of some unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters. Despite this, the scMeOAc method not only improves the quality of the biodiesel fuel but also minimizes the separation and purification steps, and therefore the energy required. Saka et al. 70 have used various supercritical carboxylate esters to convert triglycerides into FAMEs and triacetin in the absence of any catalyst.

Visual observation of the phase behaviour of the reaction mixture upon pressurization at 55 °C showed that the immiscible biphasic liquid phase, consisting of corn oil and methanol, approached a single liquid phase at pressures above the critical pressure of CO2 and also expanded through the dissolution of CO2. However, as a single homogeneous phase was not fully formed at the pressure levels investigated in this study (11.0, 20.0 and 35.0 MPa), authors consider reaction mixture as a two phase (lower single liquid phase and upper CO2 phase) system. Other authors studied the solubility of olive husk oil in scCO2 (40–80 °C, 15.0–35.0 MPa), and the influence of methanol and ethanol (1–5% v/v) as cosolvents, by using a dynamic flow method.

To achieve this goal, new non-edible potential sources of vegetable oil such as microalgae and jatropha oil, which ensure that biodiesel production does not compete with resources for food industry, should be taken into consideration, as they will help to reduce costs and increase social acceptance. One of the most important approaches for the design of more intensive and cost-effective process configurations is process integration. In this respect, SCFs technology can help to process integration by combining routes for the simultaneous extraction, transesterification and valorisation of glycerol in a single step.

Hence, the catalyst produced from sulfonated tea waste in the present study is expected to be an effective solid acid catalyst for the esterification of PFAD and could also be used for other high FFA feedstocks.","Hence, the catalyst produced from sulfonated tea waste in the present study is expected to be an effective solid acid catalyst for the esterification of PFAD and could also be used for other high FFA feedstocks.","catalyst, sulfonated, study, effective, solid acid catalyst, esterification, PFAD, FFA, feedstocks","ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY","11, 34, 70, 97, 107, 135, 153, 196, 200","19, 44, 75, 106, 126, 149, 157, 199, 210",,,,

The catalytic activity was studied to investigate the catalyst efficiency by studying the process optimization conditions. The optimization conditions revealed that the catalyst worked very well at a low temperature of 65 °C, with catalyst loading of 4 wt %, by using 9:1 PFAD to methanol ratio for 90 min of reaction time and gave 97% FFA conversion. The STW catalyst characterization results revealed that it showed very high acid density, external thermal stability and a porous nature. Regeneration and reusability of STW catalyst shows very good results up to five cycles with good FFA conversion ability. This indicates that catalyst is feasible on a commercial scale because of its diverse properties i.e., it is inexpensive, works on lower temperature and can be used multiple times. The authors believe that the STW based solid acid catalyst is an appealing catalyst for PFAD conversion into esters.

Then, they were tested for green production of biodiesel by solventless enzymatic transesterification of discarded cooking oil and methanol (1:4) at 25 °C. The results were compared with those shown by free OPEr and the commercial lipases Eversa® and Cal A®. Several preparations with immobilized OPEr produced high synthesis yields (>90% transesterification), comparable to those obtained with Eversa®, the commercial enzyme designed for this application.

The existing protocols for covalent attachment are numerous and generally involve the side chains of different amino acids located in the protein surface which are not essential for its catalytic activity 22 and various active groups in the supports 28. Amino-functionalized carriers are widely used to this purpose, and they can be further activated with bifunctional reagents such as glutaraldehyde (GA), grafting reactive aldehyde groups in the carrier’s surface and allowing multipoint attachment of the protein 25,29.

In the presence of water, the reaction can revert to hydrolysis, lowering product yields. The generally accepted mechanism of action for lipases is of the Ping-Pong Bi-Bi type, although several different models have been described to explain the transesterification of glycerides. The one-step model describes the direct alcoholysis of triglycerides, in which the alcohol is responsible for the breakdown and esterification of the released fatty acid.

Finally, immobilization of OPEr to GA-activated nanoparticles yielded the worst results, with low values for all the determined parameters. Nevertheless, the high immobilization efficiency value calculated for the AG1-GA-OPEr preparation suggests an hyperactivation of the immobilized enzyme.","Nevertheless, the high immobilization efficiency value calculated for the AG1-GA-OPEr preparation suggests an hyperactivation of the immobilized enzyme.","immobilization, calculated, AG1-GA-OPEr, preparation, hyperactivation, immobilized, enzyme","ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY, ENTITY","23, 55, 74, 86, 110, 133, 145","37, 65, 85, 97, 125, 144, 151",,,,

Recent estimation from the European Federation for Transport and Environment evidenced that since the 2000s decade, an area equal to the Netherlands was deforested to supply global biodiesel demand, mainly originating from first-generation feedstock. Nevertheless, biodiesel is renewable, and it can be a greener source of energy than petroleum. A promising approach to make biodiesel independent from large areas of farming is to shift as much as possible the biodiesel production chain to second and third generations of feedstock. The second generation presents three main advantages, where it does not compete with the food industry, its commercial value is negligible, or none, and its usage as feedstock for biodiesel production reduces the overall waste disposal. In this manuscript, we present an oligomeric catalyst designed to be multi-functional for second-generation feedstock transesterification reactions, mainly focusing our efforts to optimize the conversion of tallow fat and sauteing oil to FAME and FAEE, applying our innovative catalyst. Named as Oligocat, our catalyst acts as a Brønsted-Lowry acid catalyst, providing protons to the reaction medium, and at the same time, with the course of the reaction, it sequesters glycerol molecules from the medium and changes its physical phase during the transesterification reaction. With this set of properties, Oligocat presents a pseudo-homogenous behavior, reducing the purification and separation steps of the biodiesel process production. Reaction conditions were optimized applying a 42 factorial planning. The output parameter evaluated was the conversion rate of triacylglycerol to mono alkyl esters, measured through gel permeation chromatography (GPC). After the optimization studies, a conversion yield of 96.7 (±1.9) wt% was achieved, which allows classifying the obtained mono alkyl esters as biodiesel by ASTM D6751 or EN 14214:2003.

Precisely, ASTM D6751 standardizes the physical–chemical parameters that one has to comply with in order to label FAME as biodiesel. Chemically, biodiesel is simply a mono alkyl ester of a long chain structure that fulfills the quality control demanded by ASTM D6751.

Through factorial planning, the biodiesel synthesis was optimized for Oligocat catalysts. POS and P24 catalysts were able to provide high conversion yields of TAG’s to FA(X)E, allowing them to be classified as biodiesel according to this parameter, which is given by ASTM D6751 and EN 14214:2003. High conversion yields above 96.5 wt% of FA(X)E were obtained applying tallow swine as feedstock, with both methanol and ethanol. For sauteing oil, using ethanol, it was possible to achieve a conversion rate in the range of 90%. A significant advantage of Oligocat is its pseudo-homogeneous property that resulted in the reduction of the operational steps for biodiesel synthesis workflow. Oligocat acts initially as a homogenous catalyst, having an optimal mass transfer of the active catalytic groups to the reaction medium. With the course of chemical reaction, Oligocat sequesters glycerol, generating a strong viscous phase, which does not interact with the biodiesel phase, resulting in fewer purification and separation steps for the biodiesel process production.
