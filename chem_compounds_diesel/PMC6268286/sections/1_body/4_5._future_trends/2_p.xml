<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The extreme reaction conditions necessary when working with SCFs make any such process energy intensive. This can be counterbalanced by the improvement in mass and heat transfer intensified by the fast fluid flow conditions, hence decreasing mass-transfer limitations, and avoiding phase separation, as a consequence of the large surface area-to-volume ratio available. The use of continuous-flow/micro(mini)reactor technology improves heat and mass transfer. This makes possible the potential for higher conversion yields under milder conditions and involving reduced molar ratios of alcohol to oil, as well as lower reaction temperatures and (bio)catalysts concentrations than for conventional stirred reactors. The development of new, simple, cheap and environmentally friendly catalytic systems for biodiesel production is required. Additional studies into the economic viability of any of the approaches mentioned should be made before we can safety talk of a green chemical industry for biodiesel production.</p>
