However, as for any emerging technology, it also presents some weaknesses. These are challenging and should be solved before the industrial implementation of such methodologies. Our future efforts should move forward to simpler, cost-effective and &#8220;greener&#8221; SCFs processes, leading to high yields of a quality biodiesel fuel. To achieve this goal, new non-edible potential sources of vegetable oil such as <italic>microalgae</italic> and <italic>jatropha</italic> oil, which ensure that biodiesel production does not compete with resources for food industry, should be taken into consideration, as they will help to reduce costs and increase social acceptance. One of the most important approaches for the design of more intensive and cost-effective process configurations is process integration. In this respect, SCFs technology can help to process integration by combining routes for the simultaneous extraction, transesterification and valorisation of glycerol in a single step. Such technology should combine chemical reactions and extraction in the same step, achieving synergistic effects, and leading to an increase in selectivity, conversion, productivity and purity of the final product(s). Simpler reactive extraction processes without or with the (bio)catalysts can be a potential route for biodiesel production, greatly reducing the processing steps and costs at the same time. </p>
