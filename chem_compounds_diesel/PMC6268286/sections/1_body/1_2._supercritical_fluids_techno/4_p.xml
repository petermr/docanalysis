<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The high catalytic efficiency of porous chemical catalysts (e.g., zeolites) in SCFs has been widely reported, especially when their active sites are placed within the internal structure of the catalyst. In that case, the high mass transfer of reactants within a catalyst&#8217;s porous structure is particularly important for increasing catalysis rates [<xref rid="B16-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, many of the reports on SCFs catalysis mention that catalyst lifetime can be prolonged by eliminating undesired poisoning substances. As an example, the alkylation of benzene with ethene on Y-type zeolites (250&#8211;285 &#176;C, 7&#8211;8 MPa) in scCO<sub>2</sub> revealed a much lower catalyst deactivation, higher reaction rates, and higher selectivity. The reduction of catalyst deactivation was attributed to the removal of polyaromatics, considered to be precursors of coke, from the surface of the zeolites by increased solubility and diffusion rates. Extending catalyst lifetimes using SCF carbon dioxide reaction media, apart from the convenience of keeping the catalytic system running longer, also provides other potentially important economic benefits [<xref rid="B16-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, due to its low viscosity and high diffusivity, scCO<sub>2</sub> affords an effective and continuous cleaning within the porous catalyst structures. This good performance of heterogeneous chemical catalysts under supercritical conditions has been observed in many catalytic reactions, e.g., Fisher-Tropsh, hydroformylation, hydrogenation, Heck, Suzuki, oxidations and alkylations, even including continuous operation [<xref rid="B17-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
