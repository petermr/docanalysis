<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A supercritical fluid (SCF) is a compound, mixture, or element above its critical pressure (<italic>Pc</italic>) and critical temperature (<italic>Tc</italic>), but below the pressure required to condense into a solid [<xref rid="B14-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Under such conditions, the densities of both liquid and gas phases become identical, and the distinction between them disappears. The properties of SCFs are frequently described as being intermediate between those of a gas and a liquid. The possibility to manipulate the physical properties of these solvents by simply changing the pressure or temperature is unique to supercritical systems, which show exceptional abilities for extraction, reaction, fractionation and analysis processes. They also determine their environmentally benign character because of the easy way in which they can be fully recovered and reused. However, the key feature of SCFs is their tunability as solvents in response to changes in pressure and temperature, particularly remarkable in the vicinity of the critical point [<xref rid="B15-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <xref rid="molecules-17-08696-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the critical parameters of some common fluids used in supercritical conditions. The density of SCFs is highly sensitive to both temperature and pressure; hence, all their density-dependent solvent properties (e.g., dielectric constant, relative permittivity, Hildebrand solubility parameter, <italic>etc.</italic>) may be substantially modified by small changes in pressure or temperature. This provides a potential for controlling (bio)catalyzed reactions by precipitation of a given product, or purification by the selective precipitation of the products.</p>
