<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Several criteria must be considered before selecting a given SCF as medium for a (bio)catalyzed reaction, including the critical parameters themselves, safety and cost issues. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO<sub>2</sub>) is the most popular SCF because of its relatively low critical parameters, low toxicity and non-flammability; furthermore, it is chemically inert under most conditions, has good solvent properties for non-polar solutes, and is considered as a green solvent. Carbon dioxide is clearly a &#8220;greenhouse gas&#8221;; however, it is massively produced as a by-product at industrial scale (e.g., in ammonia plants), and it is therefore cheap. Furthermore, at atmospheric pressure, CO<sub>2</sub> is gaseous, which means that simple depressurization is sufficient to separate solutes from scCO<sub>2</sub>, after which it can be pressurized for reuse as a solvent. The solvent power of scCO<sub>2</sub> can be modified by increasing the bulk density or by adding a modifier (e.g., MeOH, acetone). Co-solvents can therefore be used to increase or reduce polarity, or to enhance the affinity for aromatic substances, although of course, the more co-solvent that is added, the further scCO<sub>2</sub> moves from being a truly green solvent. The main limitation for industrial application of SCFs is related with the cost of high-pressure equipment [<xref rid="B15-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
