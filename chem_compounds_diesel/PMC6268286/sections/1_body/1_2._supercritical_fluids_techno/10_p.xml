Those include its cost, energy consumption, and safety issues in the operation process. The SCFs technology requires expensive equipments, such as strong durable reactors, high pressure pumps, efficient control devices, <italic>etc.</italic>, and the costs involved in operation and maintenance are also higher than those of conventional processes. Furthermore, the energy consumption to reach supercritical conditions is dependent of the nature of the solvent in question (see <xref rid="molecules-17-08696-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for critical parameters), and this may be unsustainable for long term industrial application. An example is the biodiesel synthesis by non-catalytic supercritical alcohol technology requiring temperatures up to 200 &#176;C (the critical temperature of methanol is 239 &#176;C). Thus, we must bear in mind that the energy utilized in the manufacturing process should be not exceed the energy provided by this biofuel [<xref rid="B33-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Regarding the safety of SCFs processes, they are usually labelled as high risk processes because of the combination of high pressures and temperatures. The SCFs technology for the industrial production of biodiesel could be improved by the design of small reactors with enhanced catalytic efficiency, which, in combination with continuous operation approaches, may help offset the described weaknesses.</p>
