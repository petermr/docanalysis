<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The appropriate design of SCF (bio)reactors involves controlling mass-transfer limitations, environmental conditions (pressure and temperature) and product recovery. For example, Marty <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B26-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] developed a recycling packed bed enzyme reactor at pilot scale for Lipozyme<sup>&#174;</sup>-catalyzed ethyl oleate synthesis through oleic acid esterification with ethanol in scCO<sub>2</sub> [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-17-08696-f002">Figure 2</xref>(A)]. The proposed system assembled four high-pressure separator vessels, where a pressure cascade was produced by back-pressure valves, allowing a continuous recovery of the liquid product at the bottom of each separator, and then the recycling of the non-reacted substrates. Alternatively, membrane reactors constitute an attempt to integrate catalytic conversion, product separation and/or concentration and catalyst recovery into a single operation unit. Thus, enzymatic dynamic membranes, formed by depositing water-soluble polymers (e.g., gelatine, polyethyleneimine, <italic>etc.</italic>) on a ceramic porous support, exhibited appropriate properties for continuous butyl butyrate synthesis in scCO<sub>2</sub>, along with a high operational stability [<xref rid="B27-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
