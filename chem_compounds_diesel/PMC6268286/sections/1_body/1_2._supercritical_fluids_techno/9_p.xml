Several approaches have been developed to protect enzymes against these adverse effects of scCO<sub>2</sub>, including covalent attachment on supports coated with hydrophilic polymers, the entrapment of enzymes in silica-aerogels, and the use of cross-linking enzyme aggregates. In spite of the advantages obtained with all these stabilization approaches, the best results for enzyme-catalyzed reactions in scCO<sub>2</sub> were observed when the biocatalyst was applied in suspension or coated with other green solvents, such as ionic liquids, as described below [<xref rid="B19-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
