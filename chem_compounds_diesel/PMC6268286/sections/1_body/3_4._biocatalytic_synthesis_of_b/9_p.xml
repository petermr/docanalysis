<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The development of solid supports with a covalently attached IL phase is a further step towards reducing the amount of ILs used in catalytic processes in scCO<sub>2</sub>, providing permanent protection of the enzymes against the adverse effect of this SCF. Through this approach, the properties of ILs are transferred to the solid phase, leading to either particle- or monolithic-Supported Ionic Liquid-Like Phases (SILLPs) [<xref rid="B89-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This kind of material with tunable properties can be prepared on demand and they have been shown to efficiently immobilize a variety of catalysts. Indeed, the microenvironment provided by these &#8220;solid ionic liquid phases&#8221; can be modified by the modulation of the different design vectors of SILLPs [<xref rid="B90-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Bioreactors based on <italic>Candida antarctica </italic>lipase B (CALB) adsorbed onto SILLPs have been successfully applied as macroporous monolithic mini-flow systems for the continuous synthesis of citronellyl propionate in scCO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B91-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], as well as the KR and DKR of <italic>rac</italic>-1-phenyhlethanol [<xref rid="B92-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], showing in both cases good enzymatic activity and operational stability.</p>
