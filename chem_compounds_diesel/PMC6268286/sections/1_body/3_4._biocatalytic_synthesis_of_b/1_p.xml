<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The use of dense gases, mainly scCO<sub>2</sub> or propane, as alternatives to organic solvents, to provide efficient reaction media for the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel might be considered as the cleanest approach. As indicated before, the non-miscibility between triacylglycerides and methanol starting substrates, and glycerol and biodiesel final products, is rate-limiting because of the low efficiency in mass-transfer phenomena during the process, as well as the loss of activity of the biocatalyst through direct contact with methanol and glycerol. SFCs have shown to be suitable systems to overcome these drawbacks following the appropriate design of both reactor and reaction conditions.</p>
