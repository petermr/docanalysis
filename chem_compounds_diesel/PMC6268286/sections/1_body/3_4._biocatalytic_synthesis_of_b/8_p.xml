Thus, an excess in the triolein inlet flow or the continuous release of biodiesel product from the enzyme particle to the scCO<sub>2</sub> flow may dissolve the protective IL shell, enhancing continuous enzyme deactivation. Similarly, the low efficiency of the hydrophobic scCO<sub>2</sub> phase in transporting the hydrophilic by-product glycerol could led to its retention in the closest enzyme microenvironment and to the continuous biocatalyst poisoning, preventing the entry of new triolein substrate molecules. Different experimental approaches to efficiently desorb glycerol from the catalytic matrix in biodiesel synthetic processes under supercritical conditions have been proposed. Desorption was carried out using absolute ethanol under atmospheric conditions at different mass flows (10&#8211;30 g/min) or using ethanol-modified supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> (1:3 molar ratio of ethanol:CO<sub>2</sub>), under a pressure of 14.0 MPa, within a temperature range of 106&#8211;134 &#176;C and with mass flow rates of 6&#8211;34 g/min. The results showed that ethanol is an efficient solvent for this process and that the supercritical desorption is much faster than conventional desorption processes [<xref rid="B88-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p>
