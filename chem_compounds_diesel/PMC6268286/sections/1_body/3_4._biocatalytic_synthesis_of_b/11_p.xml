<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In this context, the use of different nano-structured supports, based on different 1-decyl-2-methylimidazolium cations covalently attached onto a polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) porous matrix as carriers to immobilize <italic>Candida antarctica</italic> lipase B (CALB), was recently reported (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-17-08696-f008">Figure 8</xref>) [<xref rid="B93-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The suitability of these immobilized lipase derivatives to carry out the synthesis of biodiesel (methyl oleate) through methanolysis of triolein has been tested in both <italic>tert</italic>-butanol and supercritical carbon dioxide (18.0 MPa, 45 &#176;C) as reaction media. The use of modified supports with low ionic liquid loads covalently attached to the main polymeric backbone chains provided structured materials that led to high biodiesel yields (up to 95%) and operational stability (85% biodiesel yield after 45 cycles of 8&#8211;4 h) in scCO<sub>2</sub> (45 &#176;C, 18.0 MPa). The presence of <italic>tert</italic>-butanol, as an inert co-solvent, in the scCO<sub>2</sub> phase at the same concentration as triolein was the key to avoid the continuous poisoning of the biocatalyst through the blocking of its active sites by the polar by-product (glycerol) produced in the biodiesel synthesis. These results clearly illustrate the potential of SILLP-supported biocatalysts for the production of biodiesel, which can be obtained by means of a fully green technology under continuous operation.</p>
