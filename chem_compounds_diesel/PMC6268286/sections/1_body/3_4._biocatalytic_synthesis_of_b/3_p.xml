<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The design of the supercritical reactor used has been seen to be key element for the efficiency of the (bio)catalytic synthesis of biodiesel. Both continuous and discontinuous reactors have been assayed using several types of immobilized lipases as biocatalysts, and optimized reaction conditions (pressure, temperature, cosolvents, stirring, <italic>etc.</italic>) and yields near to 100% biodiesel have been achieved. As an example of the use of discontinuous reactors, Lee <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B81-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] carried out biodiesel synthesis in scCO<sub>2</sub> using a mixture of vegetable oil and methanol (1:4 molar ratio) and a mixture of immobilized of <italic>Candida rugosa</italic> and <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic> lipases, as biocatalysts. In these studies, various factors, such as temperature, pressure, stirring speed, and the concentration of immobilized enzymes were investigated, resulting in optimal conditions for biodiesel production (100% yield at 2 h) under the following conditions: 13.0 MPa pressure, 45 &#176;C temperature, 250 rpm stirring speed, and 20% (w/w) immobilized enzyme. Furthermore, an optimized stepwise addition of methanol allowed for the maintenance of immobilized lipase activity and the recycling of the immobilized biocatalysts. The yield of these stepwise reactions was still 85% after 20 reuses.</p>
