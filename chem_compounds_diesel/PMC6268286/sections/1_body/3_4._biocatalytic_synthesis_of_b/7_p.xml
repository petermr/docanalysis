<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Biphasic systems based on ILs and scCO<sub>2</sub> have recently been used for the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel [<xref rid="B87-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. For example, a continuous enzymatic reactor, based on supported biocatalyst particles coated with hydrophobic ILs having imidazolium cations with C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>18</sub> alkyl side chains was studied for the methanolysis of triolein in scCO<sub>2</sub> at 60 &#176;C and 18.0 MPa. The operational stability of the immobilized lipase was improved by its coating with the ILs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, 1-methyl-3-octadecylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate. A final two-phase system was obtained, revealing a good catalytic behaviour in continuous operation under supercritical conditions, with up to 82% biodiesel yield after 12 cycles of 4 h. For these IL/scCO<sub>2</sub> systems, the unique properties of long chain ILs, providing a very appropriate microenvironment for enzyme-catalyzed reactions, led to a clear improvement in the efficiency for the biotransformation of vegetable oils into biodiesel. </p>
