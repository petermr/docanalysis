Jackson <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B83-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] were pioneers in the applicability of scCO<sub>2</sub> in the continuous enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel from soybean and corn oils with reaction conversions above 98% at 1 mL/min CO<sub>2</sub> flow rate, followed by complete fractionation of the reaction mixture. In order to improve the efficiency of the continuous process for biodiesel synthesis in scCO<sub>2</sub> using immobilized enzymes as catalysts, several authors described how the appropriate design of the continuous reactor may provide operational advantages (e.g., efficient mixture of substrates, continuous separation of products, enhanced operational stability of enzymes, <italic>etc.</italic>) [<xref rid="B77-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p>
