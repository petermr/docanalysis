<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The depletion of fossil fuels and increasing ecological awareness has led to a search for alternative fuels make from renewable sources such as plant biomass. In 1990 during an exhibition in Paris, a diesel engine was run for the first time for several hours using peanut oil as fuel; however the high viscosity (10&#8211;20 times higher than diesel fuel) and low volatility of vegetable oils hindered the generalised use of such fuels in combustion engines. Furthermore, the decomposition of glycerol leads to the formation of the toxic compound acrolein when vegetable oil is combusted in the engine, which further hampers the direct use of vegetable oils as fuels. Replacing the glycerol by short alkyl chain alcohols (e.g., methanol or ethanol) has since provided a low viscous and useful fuel for diesel engine [<xref rid="B1-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
