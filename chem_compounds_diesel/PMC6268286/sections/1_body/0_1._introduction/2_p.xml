This biofuel is so far considered as a good substitute for diesel fuel as it can be used in any compression ignition engine without the need for modifications. Biodiesel is safe, renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable in water, free in sulfur compounds, has a high flash point (&gt;130 &#176;C) and better lubricant properties than diesel. Its use fully complies with the aims and purposes of environmental protection [<xref rid="B2-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Biodiesel is usually synthesized through transesterification (also named alcoholysis) of triacylglycerides with methanol, yielding Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) and glycerol as by-product. Because of the reversibility of the reaction, an excess of alcohol is used to shift the equilibrium towards the products side. Three consecutive transesterification reactions are involved in the full conversion of triacylglyceride molecules to biodiesel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-17-08696-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
