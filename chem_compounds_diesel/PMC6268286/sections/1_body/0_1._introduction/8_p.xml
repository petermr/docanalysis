<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Despite being key elements in all chemical processes (e.g., mass-transport, reactions, product separation, <italic>etc.</italic>), volatile organic solvents are also responsible for a not incosiderable part of the environmental impact of the chemical industry. The search for new environmentally benign non-aqueous solvents, or green solvents, which can easily be recovered/recycled, allowing (bio)catalysts to operate efficiently, is a priority for the development of an integral green process of biodiesel synthesis. In this frame, both supercritical fluids (SCFs) and/or ionic liquids, as non-aqueous green solvents, are key targets on the current scientific agenda for biodiesel synthesis. Greenness in chemical processes also concerns the catalysts used, where lipases clearly constitute a powerful green tool for biodiesel synthesis [<xref rid="B13-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consequently, this critical review aims to analyze recent trends and progress in biodiesel synthesis using (bio)catalytic and non-catalytic SCFs technology, with special attention paid to the challenges if a fully clean technology is to be developed for biodiesel production in the near future.</p>
