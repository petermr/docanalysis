<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Several strategies have been developed to overcome these constraints. One example is the sequential addition of methanol in three different doses [<xref rid="B8-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or its storage by adsorption onto silica gel particles, acting as &#8220;microreservoirs&#8221; that slowly release the alcohol needed for the transesterification process. In this way, up to 90% biodiesel yield, together with improved catalyst recycling was obtained after 18 h of reaction [<xref rid="B9-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Alternative approaches for enzyme immobilization (e.g., encapsulation by sol-gel methods [<xref rid="B10-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], covalent attachment onto magnetic nanoparticles [<xref rid="B11-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], <italic>etc.</italic>) have also been described as improving the biocatalytic efficiency of biodiesel synthesis. Enzyme efficiency (up to 97% yield after 24 h at 50 &#176;C) is also improved by dissolution of the substrates in an organic solvent of medium polarity (e.g., <italic>tert</italic>-butanol), resulting in a one-phase reaction medium and avoiding the direct interaction between the enzyme and pure methanol [<xref rid="B12-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
