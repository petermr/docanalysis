As far as all catalyzed reactions are concerned, Nature has always been a source of inspiration for chemists. To transfer the exquisite efficiency shown by enzymes in Nature to chemical processes may well constitute the most powerful toolbox for developing a clean and sustainable chemical industry. Biodiesel synthesis by transesterification and/or esterification using immobilized lipase catalysis is applicable to both refined and raw plant oils, free fatty acids, waste fats from frying, tallow and other waste fats. A small excess of alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol or propanol) provides a high biodiesel yields under mild conditions (20&#8211;60 &#176;C) [<xref rid="B5-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Low water concentrations in the reaction medium can have a positive impact on biodiesel production. In the same way, the conversion of free fatty acids (FFAs) can be much higher than in base catalyzed processes. In this case, both triacylglycerides and FFAs can simultaneously be converted to biodiesel since lipase efficiently catalyzes both transesterification and esterification. Finally, upon completion of the transesterification process, the glycerol (lower phase) is simply separated from the biodiesel (upper phase) and neither product deodorization nor neutralization is required [<xref rid="B6-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
