<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Probably, the most intriguing feature in the catalytic synthesis of biodiesel is the phase behaviour of the reaction system during the transformation process. The starting materials, triacylglycerides and methanol, are non-miscible, as well as the final products, glycerol and biodiesel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-17-08696-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This phenomenon leads to the low efficiency of immobilized enzymes and their deactivation due to poisoning as results of the adsorption of the continuously formed glycerol by-product onto the support. In this context, both reactor design and reaction medium engineering (e.g., the use of cosolvents, different reaction conditions, <italic>etc.</italic>) are essential approaches to improve the performance of the heterogeneous (bio)catalysts. However, the most important drawback to apply biocatalysts in biodiesel synthetic processes is the high cost of enzymes, making necessary to develop stable and reusable biocatalytic systems for extended operation times [<xref rid="B5-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
