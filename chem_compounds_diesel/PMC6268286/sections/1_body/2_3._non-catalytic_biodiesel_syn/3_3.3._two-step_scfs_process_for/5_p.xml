<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The same group has also reported a &#8220;two-step&#8221; process, in which first step is a transesterification of the oil to triacetin carried out in either subcritical or supercritical acetic acid, followed by supercritical methanol treatment. A transesterification reaction occurs between acetic acid and the triglycerides under subcritical conditions without the addition of catalysts. It was clear that fatty acids and triacetin could be obtained at high yields (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-17-08696-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The reaction rate in acetic acid was much higher than when either methyl acetate or methanol was used in the transesterification step. The yield of triacetin recovery from subcritical acetic acid treatment by aqueous washing was 64%. On the other hand, when the oil phase from the previous treatment containing fatty acids was supplied to the supercritical methanol process at 270 &#176;C and 17 MPa for 15 min, a 97 wt% yield of FAMEs was obtained. The recovery rate of biodiesel fuel from this process was 117wt%, a higher value than that obtained by conventional biodiesel fuel manufacturing processes, which produce glycerol as a by-product. This recovery rate is also higher than for the recently reported supercritical methyl acetate method (<italic>Saka and Isayama method</italic>) [<xref rid="B76-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. </p>
