<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The first example developed according to this concept is known as the &#8220;Saka-Dadan&#8221; SCF method. In the first step the unique properties of scH<sub>2</sub>O are exploited. It is well known that the dielectric constant of water decreases from &#949; = 80 at standard T and P to &#949; = 31 at 225 &#176;C, P = 10.0 MPa, and finally to &#949; = 6 at the critical point, <italic>Tc</italic> = 374.15 &#176;C, <italic>Pc</italic> = 22.1 MPa, due to the steady decrease in the effectiveness of the hydrogen bonds with increasing temperature [<xref rid="B73-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Thus, the reduction of the dielectric constant with increasing temperature promotes the miscibility between water and the oil, favouring a hydrolysis process. Furthermore, at a constant pressure of 25 MPa, the ionic product of water increases with temperature until it reaches a maximum (10<sup>&#8722;11</sup>) at 250 &#176;C. This allows acid- and base-catalysed reactions to be performed in high temperature pressurized water with no catalyst. Hence, scH<sub>2</sub>O is used as both the solvent and the catalyst for the hydrolysis step at 270 &#176;C, 7 MPa and a volumetric water/triglyceride ratio of 1:1 [<xref rid="B74-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. These conditions are milder than those reported for the original one step in scMeOH (350 &#176;C and 20&#8211;50 MPa), thus reducing the energy consumption. After hydrolysis, two layers are formed, the upper portion containing fatty acids and the lower portion water with glycerol. In a second step, FAMEs are produced in supercritical methanol after 20 min at 270 &#176;C and 7 MPa (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-17-08696-f005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
