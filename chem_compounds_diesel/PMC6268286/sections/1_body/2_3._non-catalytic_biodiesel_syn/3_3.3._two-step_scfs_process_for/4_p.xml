This consists of the hydrolysis of triglycerides to fatty acids in subcritical water (270 &#176;C and 27 MPa) followed in a second step by the esterification of fatty acids to FAME in supercritical dimethyl carbonate (300 &#176;C and 9 MPa) [<xref rid="B65-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Various parameters affecting the yield of fatty acids and FAMEs have been studied and a production scheme has been proposed. The supercritical dimethyl carbonate method is applicable to oils with a high free fatty acid contents such as <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> oil, with 13.6 wt% free fatty acids. The glycerol produced in the first step was valorized in the second step, obtaining glycerol carbonate in supercritical dimethyl carbonate (280&#8211;300 &#176;C and 9&#8211;12 MPa) without any catalyst [<xref rid="B75-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The glycerol showed higher rate of conversion to glycerol carbonate due to its high purity. This glycerol conversion process was coupled with hydrolyzed fatty acids conversion into FAMEs to establish the two-step supercritical dimethyl carbonate method (Saka and Ilham Process). The non-catalytic two-step supercritical dimethyl carbonate method is a good process to produce high yields of FAMEs, even from oils with high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, together with a value added by-product, glycerol carbonate, under non-acidic and mild reaction conditions [<xref rid="B68-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p>
