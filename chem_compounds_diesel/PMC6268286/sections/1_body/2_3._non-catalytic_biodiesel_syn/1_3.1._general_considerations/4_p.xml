Both ethanol and, especially, methanol, have been reported as supercritical fluids for biodiesel synthesis [<xref rid="B43-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], although other fluids in supercritical conditions (e.g., dimethyl carbonate, methyl acetate) have also been evaluated [<xref rid="B45-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. </p>
