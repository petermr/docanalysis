<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Product separation and isolation along with catalyst recovery are by far the most energy intensive steps in biodiesel production and, therefore, the most economically unfavorable. Supercritical fluid technology may provide some advantages, facilitating these separation and isolation processes. The use of a supercritical fluid phase as solvent/reagent for biodiesel synthesis seems, accordingly, a straightforward approach. Taking into account that the nature of the solvent is controlled by the pressure and temperature, the formation of a single phase between the reagents and the triglycerides can be induced. Although high pressures (&gt;5 MPa) and temperatures (&gt;200 &#176;C) are needed to reach a homogeneous phase, the transesterification reaction kinetics is favoured under these harsh conditions. Indeed, the reaction can proceed in the absence of any catalyst, leading to non-catalytic biodiesel synthesis. Furthermore, the downstream isolation of the biodiesel from glycerol is simpler since many discrete operations such as catalyst neutralization and separation are not required, leading to products of higher purity, which is also important from a economic point of view. Thus, SCFs technology, even though it requires the use of high temperatures and pressures, may provide distinct advantages in comparison over conventional technologies. For instance, in the conventional alkali-catalyzed method, the final glycerol phase contains methanol, water, alkaline catalyst and soap. Thus, the selling price value of this crude glycerol is extremely low compared with the purified glycerol commonly used in food and pharmaceutical products [<xref rid="B34-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. </p>
