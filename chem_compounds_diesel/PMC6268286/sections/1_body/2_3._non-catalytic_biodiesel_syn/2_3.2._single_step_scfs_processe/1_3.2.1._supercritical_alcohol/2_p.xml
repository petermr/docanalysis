In supercritical alcohols, esterification of the FFAs to the corresponding fatty acid alkyl esters takes place simultaneously to oil transesterification, yielding higher amounts of biodiesel. Thus, low cost feedstock, usually containing high portions of FFA/oil, can be used in the process without any additional pretreatment. As regards the water content, transesterification reactions catalyzed under acid or alkaline conditions are highly sensitive to the presence of water as hydrolysis of the corresponding esters are favoured in the presence of water. In contrast, the non-catalytic supercritical process can be performed even with a high water contents [<xref rid="B62-molecules-17-08696" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>
