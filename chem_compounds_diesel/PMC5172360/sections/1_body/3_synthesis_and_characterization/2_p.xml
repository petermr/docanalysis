<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The Sg-CN catalyst was characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>13</sup>C-NMR). The SEM analysis clearly indicates the incorporation of sulfonic group in the graphitic carbon nitride framework; change in morphology of g-CN after sulfonation was also discerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
