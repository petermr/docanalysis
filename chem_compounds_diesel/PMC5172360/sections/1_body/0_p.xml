<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The Energy is the key driving force for the habitants on the planet and is essential for sustaining transportation, industrialization, technological advancement and daily needs. The most common source to meet the energy demand is fossil-based petroleum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, although technological advances have reduced the immediate threat which might have occurred due to its scarcity. Adequate supplies of petroleum are available which is reflected in the steady fall in the price of petroleum products. The extensive use of petroleum in the transportation and industrial sector<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> coupled with burning of huge amount of fossil fuels culminate in the release of copious amounts of toxic gases namely oxides of sulfur, carbon and nitrogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Environmental and air pollution is an immediate threat to human health emanating from the consumption of fossil fuels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Air contamination by sulfur and nitrogenous gases mainly originate from impurities present in petroleum products, thereby contributing to global warming. Continued explorations to identify safer alternatives to substitute for the petroleum products is driven largely due to growing concern over the change in an ecological system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Benign options are sought that are devoid of heteroatom impurities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
