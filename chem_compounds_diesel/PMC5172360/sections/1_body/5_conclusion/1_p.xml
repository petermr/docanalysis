<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A sulfonated graphitic carbon nitride (Sg-CN) has been synthesized <italic>via</italic> simple sulfonation and its application has been demonstrated in the efficient synthesis of biodiesel. The unique attribute of Sg-CN is its unprecedented reactivity which enables the esterification at room temperature, affording product that does not require any purification. The salient features of this catalyst include its relatively benign nature, easy accessibility, low cost and stability over several reaction cycles.</p>
