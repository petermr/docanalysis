<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">After establishing the optimum catalyst charge required for efficient esterification, a broader scope of the reaction was explored deploying a wide range of fatty acids and their analogues for the esterification and biodiesel production (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). Most of the long chain fatty acids were efficiently converted into corresponding esters. The presence of unsaturation in the backbone does not affect the reaction outcome as all the acids were converted into corresponding esters almost in quantitative yield. Treatment of a bi-functional dicarboxylic acid with Sg-CN under similar conditions afforded the corresponding diester (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>, entry 5) although a relatively longer reaction time was required.</p>
