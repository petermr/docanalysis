<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The stabilty and recyclability aspects of the catalyst were studied thereafter using oleic acid and Sg-CN. Upon reaction completion, the catalyst was seperated, washed with methanol, dried under vacuum and reused for the next set of reactants. The outcome of the recycling experiments authenticate that the catalyst can be reused up to 5 cycles without any loss in activity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary, Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
