<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The application of Sg-CN was explored in the synthesis of biodiesel <italic>via</italic> the esterification of fatty acids. Oleic acid was used as a model substrate to optimize of reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Initially, one gram of oleic acid was treated with 100&#8201;mg of Sg-CN in methanol at room temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, entry 1) and the reaction was monitored using GC-MS at regular time intervals of time. Complete conversion of oleic acid to the corresponding methyl ester occurred within 4&#8201;hours. The most enthusing observation was the product purity attained after a simple decantation and distillation of reaction mixture. Experiments were conducted then to determine the optimum catalyst charge required for this efficient fatty acid esterification. Accordingly, oleic acid was treated with 75&#8201;mg, 50&#8201;mg, 25&#8201;mg, 10&#8201;mg and 5&#8201;mg of Sg-CN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, entries 2&#8211;5). Complete conversion of oleic acid to methyl oleate was discerned again (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, entries 2&#8211;4) whereas the reaction with 10&#8201;mg of Sg-CN required overnight stirring for the completion of esterification at room temperature. However, further reduction in Sg-CN quantity does not allow the reaction to be completed even after 24&#8201;hours of stirring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, entry 6). A control experiment with pure support g-CN has been performed under similar conditions; even a trace of the product formation after 24&#8201;hours was not discernible. After finding optimum catalyst loading of Sg-CN, it was imperative to compare our results with the reported acid catalyst. We were pleasantly surprised to see that Sg-CN completed the reaction within 4&#8201;h at room temperature which was not precedence in earlier reports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref></p>
