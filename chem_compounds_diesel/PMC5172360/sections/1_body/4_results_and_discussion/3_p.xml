<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The transesterification reactions were also performed using ethyl benzoate and ethyl cinnamate using methanol as a solvent and Sg-CN as a catalyst (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary, Table S1</xref>). GCMS (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary</xref>) confirmed that the equilibrium shift completed towards the corresponding methyl esters. The solidification of the reaction towards the right may be due to higher concentration of methanol which is used as a reaction media in transesterification.</p>
