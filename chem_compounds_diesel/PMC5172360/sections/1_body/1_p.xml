<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Biodiesel has been recognized as a greener alternative to petroleum-based products<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and can be synthesized from the fat (a waste product in the meat processing industry) and a variety of vegetable oils. The fatty acids in fat and vegetable oils can be converted into biodiesel <italic>via</italic> esterification. Several pathways have been identified to convert fatty acids to biodiesel using acid catalysts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The homogeneous acid catalysts applied in the synthesis of biodiesel carry the burden of tedious purification processes which directly impacts production costs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Most acidic heterogeneous catalysts entail the use of toxic transition metals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, metal oxides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, metal organic frame work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and metal nano-particles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Porous carbon, polar silica and petroleum polymers have also been utilized in the esterification of fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The main drawback of these catalysts has been high reaction temperatures, use of a hazardous support and the cost of the product. Often the catalyst is costlier then the product itself.</p>
