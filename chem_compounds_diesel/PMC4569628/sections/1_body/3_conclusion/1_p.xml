<sup>2</sup> and prediction values 0.992 and 0.9843 for <italic>C. salina,</italic> 0.9878 and 0.9961 for <italic>N. oculata</italic> were its growth and lipid production.The maximum lipid production of <italic>C. salina</italic> was found to be 28.26&#160;% dry weight for nitrogen-repleted condition and 37.53&#160;% dry weight for nitrogen-depleted condition. Maximum lipid production was found to be 33.18 and 54.26&#160;% dry weight for nitrogen-repleted and -depleted conditions, respectively. This work also revealed that lipid was produced at a greater quantity when cells were grown under stress, i.e., nitrogen starvation condition, which reverted carbohydrate and protein metabolism to lipid. Furthermore, the lipid formation coefficient (<italic>&#945;</italic>) was greater than nongrowth correlation coefficient (<italic>&#946;</italic>), which reveals that the lipid production in <italic>C. salina</italic> and <italic>N. oculata</italic> was growth associated. This kinetic study will be useful in the analysis of commercialization of microalgal biodiesel by increasing the scaling up process.</p>
