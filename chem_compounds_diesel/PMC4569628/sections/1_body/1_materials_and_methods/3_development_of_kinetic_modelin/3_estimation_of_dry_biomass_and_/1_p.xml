The paste, rinsed with distilled water to remove residual salts, was dried in a hot air oven at 60&#160;&#176;C for 8&#160;h. The lipid was extracted from dry biomass using Bligh and Dyer&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1959</xref>) method with slight modification. The amount of oil extracted (%&#160;w/w) was calculated according to Suganya and Renganathan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>).</p>
