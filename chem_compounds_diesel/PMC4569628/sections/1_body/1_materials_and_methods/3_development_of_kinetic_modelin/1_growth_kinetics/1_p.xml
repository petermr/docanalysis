Many growth kinetic models are available; among these, the logistic model uses simple calculation for studying microbial growth, because it is independent of substrate consumption and is highly suitable for autotrophic culture of microalgae (Khavarpour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>; Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). The rate of growth of cells is directly proportional to the cell mass concentration at the given time. When the cell mass reaches the stationary phase, the growth rate ceases. A gradual decrease is observed in the late exponential phase or when the cells are near the stationary phase. The advantage of this model is that it facilitates the exponential phase and endogenous metabolic phase. Hence, the logistic equation (Bailley and Ollis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1986</xref>) was selected for this study and expressed as follows.</p>
