<italic>Chlorella salina</italic> and <italic>Nannochloropsis oculata</italic> were obtained from Central Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, India, and was cultivated in 25&#160;L photobioreactor using sterile Walne&#8217;s medium. The filtered sterilized seawater was enriched with the required quantity of Walne&#8217;s medium (Manikandan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>) containing (g&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>): NaNO<sub>3</sub>, 100; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&#183;2H<sub>2</sub>O, 20.0; Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 4.0; H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 33.6; MnCl<sub>2</sub>&#183;4H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.36; FeCl<sub>3</sub>&#183;6H<sub>2</sub>O, 13.0; vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, 0.001 and vitamin B<sub>1</sub>, 0.02. The trace metal solution contained (g&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>): ZnSO<sub>4</sub>&#183;7H<sub>2</sub>O, 4.4; CoCl<sub>2</sub>&#183;6H<sub>2</sub>O, 2.0; (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub> H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.9; and CuSO<sub>4</sub>&#183;5H<sub>2</sub>O, 2.0. The medium was adjusted to pH 8 and autoclaved at 121&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;min. The filter-sterilized vitamins were added after cooling and the culture maintained under 5,000 lux illuminated at 12:12&#160;h light and dark condition for 15&#160;days at room temperature. One photobioreactor was filled with nitrogen-rich Walne&#8217;s medium and another with the same medium with nitrogen for the first 4&#160;days, after which the nutrients were added to the reactor without nitrogen for scaling up.</p>
