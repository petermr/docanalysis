Moreover, biodiesel production from microalgae mainly depends on the availability of biomass and scale-up process that needs optimization, to reduce cost (Decostere et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). The kinetics deals with how the rate of the reaction is dependent on the concentration of the reactants. For the cells to multiply and grow, a certain amount of substrate and other required components from the production medium is consumed (Rao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). Kinetic models serves in designing a bioreactor, controlling the microbial processes and predicting the behavior of the processes more easily than laboratory experiments (Bailley and Ollis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1986</xref>). To learn the dynamics of biomass growth and lipid production by microalgae, suitable kinetic modeling has to be developed for predicting the performance and optimization of photobioreactor operating conditions (Galvao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). Many research studies have been conducted and many mathematical models proposed for microalgal growth and lipid production. Recent mathematical studies showed that under photoheterotrophic conditions, microalgae accumulate more amount of intracellular oil (triglyceride-TAG) than during photoautotrophic cultivation. Extensive literature survey shows that most of the modeling papers only focus on heterotrophic growth of microalgae and very few reports are available on kinetic modeling of algae growth and lipid production under nitrogen-depleted conditions.</p>
