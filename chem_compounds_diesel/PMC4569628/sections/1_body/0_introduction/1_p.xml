Continuous use of fossil fuels, resulting in greenhouse gases accumulation, leads to global warming (Xin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>). Biodiesel, produced generally from food and oil crops using conventional methods (Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>), is an alternative biofuel which is renewable, biodegradable, nontoxic with no net carbon emissions and free from sulfur (Li and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>; Kirrolia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2013</xref>). Plant sources cannot realistically fulfill the vast usage of diesel fuel due to increasing population that leads to serious land shortage and rise in the issue of food security (Surendhiran and Vijay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). Microalgae, the photosynthetic microorganisms, thus have become the recent attraction because of their high oil content, with lipids being the intracellular storage matter (Xiao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>). Microalgae can be grown in wastewater as they do not compete with food crops for arable land and water and give 20 times more biomass productivity rate than terrestrial crops (Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>; Mutanda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>; Lai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>).</p>
