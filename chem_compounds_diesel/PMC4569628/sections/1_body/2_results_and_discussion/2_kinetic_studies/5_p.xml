(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>) reported that under nitrogen-deficient conditions, algal cells often accumulate a surplus of carbon metabolites as neutral lipids more than polar lipids. It was also reported that microalgae respond to the nitrogen starvation condition by degrading nitrogen-containing macromolecules and accumulating carbon reserve compounds for the maintenance of cells, such as lipids.</p>
