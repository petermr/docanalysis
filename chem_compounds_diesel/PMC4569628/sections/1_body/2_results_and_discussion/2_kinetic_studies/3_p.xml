This leads to a slower growing or even contracting overall biomass, but an increase in oil production (James and Boriah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). The maximum lipid production by <italic>C. salina</italic> was found to be 28.26 and 37.53&#160;% dry weight for nitrogen-repleted and -depleted conditions, respectively, whereas for <italic>N. oculata</italic> the maximum lipid production was found to be 33.18 and 54.26&#160;% dry weight nitrogen-repleted and -depleted conditions, respectively.</p>
