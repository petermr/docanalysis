To minimize the production cost, a variety of non-conventional (non-edible) oils/fats such as rapeseed, tallow, rubber seed oil, kapok seed oil, jatropha oil, palm fatty acid distillate and used cooking oil were investigated by many researchers as substitute to edible oils [<xref rid="B8-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) which is one of the waste by-products is produced during the refining process of palm oil and according to Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), 782048 tonnes of PFAD was produced in 2018, during the processing of palm oil [<xref rid="B10-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. PFAD consists of more than 85 wt % of FFA [<xref rid="B11-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As the cost of PFAD is much less than refined oil, use of PFAD as feedstock can potentially improve the palm oil waste management and makes more profits for the industry [<xref rid="B12-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p>
