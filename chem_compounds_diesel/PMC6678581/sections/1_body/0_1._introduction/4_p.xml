<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Recently, different types of supports material such as zeolites, mixed oxides, sulphated zirconia, and ion-exchange resins have been used for preparation of heterogeneous catalysts for ester production [<xref rid="B17-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, numerous disadvantages associated with the use of these catalysts were reported in terms of cost, intensive reaction conditions, and poor reusability which ultimately increased the production cost of the biodiesel [<xref rid="B20-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Alternatively, low cost, inexpensive support material produced from biomass gained attraction in the last few years for heterogeneous catalyst preparation [<xref rid="B22-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this connection biomass-based carbon or activated carbon gained attraction because of its diverse physiochemical properties, easy availability, and less costly stuff.</p>
