<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Tea is one of most common drinks around the world. Tea (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) leaves comprises 4&#8211;7% cellulose, 5&#8211;6% lignin, 5&#8211;6% hemicellulose, 14&#8211;17% proteins, 3&#8211;7% lipids and 5&#8211;6% pectin. It is estimated that the production of tea was more than 3.8 million in 2008 [<xref rid="B24-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thousands of tons of tea are used for drinking purposes around the world and this produces a huge pile of solid waste. In Malaysia, tea is used in many different forms and is one of favorite drinks of adults. After preparing tea, the waste is usually disposed of as solid waste. Previously, tea waste was used for different applications such as an adsorbent for industrial wastewater treatment, for preparation of activated carbon (AC) for purification of waste cooking oil esters and for hydrogen production [<xref rid="B25-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, there is no such study found in literature on tea waste used for the preparation of acidic catalyst and its application for ester conversion. </p>
