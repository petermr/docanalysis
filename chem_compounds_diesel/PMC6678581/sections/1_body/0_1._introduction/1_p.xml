Fossil fuel is the leading energy provider among all energy basic sources. Depletion of fossil fuel resources is the hot topic among the energy providers and other stakeholders [<xref rid="B1-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Biodiesel has been recognized as a substitute to commercial fuel due to similarity in their characteristics. Biodiesel is a blend of long chain alkyl esters produced through transesterification/esterification reaction of oils or fats with alcohol in the presence of catalyst [<xref rid="B2-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The ester production is achieved through transesterification using a homogeneous catalyst i.e., potassium and sodium hydroxide [<xref rid="B3-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Conventionally hydrochloric and sulfuric acid were used as homogeneous acid catalysts for the esterification process of feedstock containing high free fatty acids (FFA). The disadvantages of homogeneous acid catalysts are saponification or emulsion formation and a complicated and costly separation process is required. Moreover, the purification process is also very complicated and produces a lot of waste [<xref rid="B4-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p>
