<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Currently, several research papers have reported on the novel heterogeneous solid catalyst that have just been developed for various applications, however, only a few research papers have reported the utilization of waste materials as a new valuable catalyst for production of biodiesel [<xref rid="B13-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Heterogeneous catalysts are favored over homogeneous catalysts due to various advantages i.e., they are easily recoverable from the product, less hazardous, compatible in various applications, user friendly, possible in modification, and recyclable which leads to considerable decrease in the production cost [<xref rid="B15-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the main obstacle faced by researchers and investors is their expensive synthesis which makes the production cost relatively high. In heterogeneous catalysis a support with a high surface area to which the catalyst is affixed is usually very costly and this makes the whole process very expensive [<xref rid="B16-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. </p>
