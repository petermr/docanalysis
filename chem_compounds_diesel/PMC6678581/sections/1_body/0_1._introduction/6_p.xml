<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">PFAD holds a high content of FFA, therefore, the major motive behind this work was to synthesize a novel sulfonated tea waste catalyst for the esterification process of PFAD. Moreover, the detailed characterization and work out of the produced catalyst on the reaction parameters were investigated to achieve better biodiesel production. A reusability study of the produced catalyst has also been studied.</p>
