After the reaction, the separated catalyst was collected and washed with acetone and hexane for removal of the trapped solvent and then the washed catalyst was dried at 70 &#176;C for 6 h. After every cycle, acid content and ester conversion were determined to check the efficiency of the catalyst. </p>
