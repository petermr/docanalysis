<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The tea waste and soaked tea waste samples were used to prepare the char samples. Briefly, 10 g of each tea waste and soaked tea waste were heated to produce incomplete carbonized carbon at 400 &#176;C for 5 h in the presence of inert gas at flow of 10 cm<sup>3</sup> min<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Using hot distilled water, the produced char samples were washed many times until pH was ~7, and then dried in oven at 70 &#176;C for 24 h. From these dried char samples sulfonated acidic catalysts were prepared by mixing 5 g of each char sample with 98% concentrated sulfuric acid in a closed cup autoclave and heated at 160 &#176;C for 6 h. To remove the unreacted sulfuric acid, the obtained catalysts were then washed with hot distilled water (~70 &#176;C). After washing both the catalysts were dried at 70 &#176;C in an oven overnight for complete removal of moisture. The sulfonated tea waste catalyzed esterification reaction mechanism is presented in <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="materials-12-02293-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>.</p>
