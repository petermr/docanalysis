<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For esterification of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), a 250 mL three-neck round bottom glass flask outfitted with a condenser, thermocouple and magnetic stirrer was used. The reactor was setup in an oil bath (silicon oil) for homogenized heating on a hot plate. Esterification was performed using 2wt % to 5wt % of catalyst loading and varying the methanol to PFAD molar ratio from 3:1 to 12:1. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 &#176;C to 70 &#176;C and from 30 min to 120 min. In each run, 25 g of PFAD was used and at the end of each reaction, the sample was separated out by using high-speed centrifuge at 7000 RPM for 10 min. After centrifuge, three layers were obtained: the upper layer was ester, the intermediate was water, and the lower layer was solid catalyst. The catalyst separated was collected for a reusability study. The upper layer (ester phase) was further purified using a rotary evaporator to remove the excess methanol and filtered to remove any solid impurities. The purified esters phase was recovered and preserved for further analysis. </p>
