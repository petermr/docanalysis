<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The tea waste (TW) char was synthesized using the chemical activation method. Briefly, 20 g of tea waste was soaked in 10% orthophosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) solution for 12 h activation of the tea char waste. After the specified time, it was dried at room temperature and saved for calcination prior to sulfonation. The dried TW powder was carbonized under a stream of N<sub>2</sub> by raising the temperature to 700 &#176;C for 2 h with a heating rate increase of 5 &#176;C/min. </p>
