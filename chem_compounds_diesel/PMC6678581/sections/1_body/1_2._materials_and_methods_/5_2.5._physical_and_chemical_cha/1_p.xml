<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The prepared sulfonated tea waste (STW) catalysts were analyzed in detail through several instrumentations. Furthermore, the active sites density was assessed by using the temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (ThermoFinnigan, TPDRO 1100 series, Waltham, MA, USA) which was coupled with thermal conductivity detector. Prior to analysis, the sample was flushed with N<sub>2</sub> gas for 1 h and heated up to 150 &#176;C for removal of any impurities and water moisture in the sample and reactor system. The sample was further pretreated with ammonia gas for 1 h, at ambient temperature to introduce the ammonia molecules on to the catalyst structure. Again, the sample was flushed with N<sub>2</sub> gas for 30 min to eliminate any ammonia gas held in the reactor system. The analysis was continued by heating the sample in the temperature range 50 &#176;C to 950 &#176;C at 5 &#176;C min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in the presence of helium at a flow rate of 20 cm<sup>3</sup> min<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The amount of ammonia gas desorbed during the heating process was equivalent to the number of active sites on the catalyst. </p>
