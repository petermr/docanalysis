<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The surface characteristics of the STW catalysts were evaluated through N<sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption by using BET micromeritics 3 Flex analyzer (Norcross, GA, USA), while, the crystallinity of the catalyst was determined through X-ray diffraction technique, Shimadzu XRD6000 with scan rate at 2&#176; min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and scan range from 2&#176; to 80&#176;. The morphological analysis of the catalyst was studied via field emission scanning electron microscope (Lausanne, Switzerland). The introduced functional groups after pretreatment and the activation processes were determined by using the Perkin Elmer, 1725X Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (Waltham, MA, USA) The sample was scanned from 500 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to 4000 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to get the IR absorption data. Thermal stability of the tea waste char and catalyst were performed using the NETZSCH (STA 449 F3, Netzsch, Selb, Germany) thermogravimetric analyzer. Briefly, a 10 mg of sample was heated from 40 &#176;C to 900 &#176;C at 10 &#176;C min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in an inert environment at flow rate of 40 mL min<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Elemental composition (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur content) of tea waste char and synthesized catalyst was determined by Vario MRCO cube analyzer by following the EN151004:2005 standard method. </p>
