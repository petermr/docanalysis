<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A summary of the catalytic activity of different residues valorized as catalyst support in the synthesis of sulfonated char catalysts to produce esters, or biodiesel is presented in <xref rid="materials-12-02293-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Sulfonated sugarcane bagasse, sulfonated multiwalled carbon nanotubes and sulfonated magnetic solid acid catalysts need higher methanol to PFAD molar ratio and reaction temperature, whereas, sulfonated sugarcane bagasse requires more catalyst loading as compared to the sulfonated tea waste catalyst. However, sulfonated tea waste (produced in this study) showed better reaction time as compared to previously synthesized catalysts. The catalyst produced in this study showed better reusability as compared to sulfonated sugarcane bagasse, cacao shell-derived solid acid catalyst, sulfonating carbonized corn straw and sulfonated magnetic solid acid catalysts (<xref rid="materials-12-02293-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Hence, the catalyst produced from sulfonated tea waste in the present study is expected to be an effective solid acid catalyst for the esterification of PFAD and could also be used for other high FFA feedstocks.</p>
