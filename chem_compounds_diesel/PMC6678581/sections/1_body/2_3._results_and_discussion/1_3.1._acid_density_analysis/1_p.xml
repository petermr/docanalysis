Therefore, ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD) was used for measuring the acid strength of tea waste char and sulfonated tea waste catalysts. <xref rid="materials-12-02293-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> depicts that the sulfonated tea waste (STW) catalyst pre-treated with H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> exhibited the highest acid density of 31 &#956;mol g<sup>&#8722;1</sup> as compared to the tea waste (TW) char, which only went through the soaking process with H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and showed less total acid density of 16.8 &#956;mol g<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. It was also observed that the treatment of the incomplete carbonized tea waste with the phosphoric acid increased surface area of the TW char itself, which gave extra anchor sites for the attachment of the active sulfonic groups on the catalyst structure.</p>
