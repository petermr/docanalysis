It was found that the FESEM image of sulfonated tea waste char was rough, amorphous and had a heterogeneous structure, whereas the sulfonated tea waste char catalyst which was initially treated with phosphoric acid showed a very clear porous structure on the char surface. Konwar et al. [<xref rid="B31-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] observed that the pretreatment of carbon catalyst with phosphoric acid has led to a porous carbon structure with high surface area associated with highly active sites and these findings agree well with our results.</p>
