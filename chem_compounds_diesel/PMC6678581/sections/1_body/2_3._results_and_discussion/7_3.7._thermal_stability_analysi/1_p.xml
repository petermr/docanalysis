<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The thermal stability of tea waste char and tea waste char based acidic catalysts were examined by thermogravimetric analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02293-f004">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the mass loss trend of char and catalyst with increasing temperature under inert atmosphere. The tea waste char sample showed a linear kind of trend and by increasing the temperature from 40 &#176;C to 400 &#176;C no appreciable mass loss was observed, from 400 &#176;C to 800 &#176;C maximum loss in mass was noted and then onward no mass loss was detected. Whereas STW showed a different trend, with maximum mass loss in between 40 &#176;C to 250 &#176;C which can be collectively contributed to the evolution of moisture and decomposition/evaporation of S contents present in &#8722;SO<sub>3</sub>H. Further mass loss could be credited to the incomplete pyrolysis of tea waste because initially tea waste pyrolysis was performed at 400 &#176;C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that the tea waste char catalysts were thermally stable for the sulfonation process. </p>
