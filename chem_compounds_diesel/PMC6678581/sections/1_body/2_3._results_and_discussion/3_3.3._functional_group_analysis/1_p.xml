The presence of sulfonic groups (&#8722;SO<sub>3</sub>H) can be detected by the IR absorption at 1190 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for &#8722;SO<sub>2</sub> asymmetric stretching and at about 1040 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for the &#8722;SO<sub>2</sub> symmetric stretching mode [<xref rid="B28-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Almost similar results were also reported by Lokman et al. [<xref rid="B30-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] for a sulfonated carbon catalyst obtained from waste carbohydrates. This shows that the sulfonation process introduced or generated the sulfonic functional groups that covalently bonded on the carbon chain structure of the catalyst. Even though, the hydroxyl group (&#8722;OH) was clearly observed by the appearance of the broad absorption peak at around 3500 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to 3000 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Another peak was noticed at 1590 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> corresponding to the carbonyl, C=O stretching mode for the carboxylic groups, &#8722;COOH.</p>
