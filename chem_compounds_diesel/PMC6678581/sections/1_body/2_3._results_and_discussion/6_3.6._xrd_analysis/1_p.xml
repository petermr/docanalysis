It was observed that both tea waste char and sulfonated tea waste (STW) catalyst exhibit identical trends of XRD peaks, broad and weak C(002), C(100) and C(101) around 2&#952; from 25&#176;&#8211;28&#176;, and 40&#176;&#8211;50&#176;, respectively. Whereas, STW catalyst showed the other peaks at around 12&#176;, 30&#176;, 56&#176;&#8211;68&#176; belong to S(001), S(110), S(111) and S(004) respectively [<xref rid="B32-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The presence of sulfur was identified also during the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (<xref rid="materials-12-02293-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The peaks in this region correspond to the amorphous carbon structure which is in accord with the results reported by Yu et al. [<xref rid="B33-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Konwar et al. [<xref rid="B31-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
