<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The influence of reaction time was investigated from 30 min to 120 min keeping other parameters constant such as catalyst loading of 4 wt %, methanol to PFAD molar ratio 9:1 and reaction temperature 65 &#176;C at 350 RPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02293-f008">Figure 8</xref>). It was observed that with an increase in reaction time FFA conversion was observed to increase. Maximum FFA conversion of 97% was achieved at 90 min of reaction time; however, further increase in reaction time reduced the FFA conversion. These observations are in conformity with earlier reported results [<xref rid="B42-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. There are several possible reasons of a decrease in the FFA conversion after 90 min, such as increase in water concentration within the reaction media which has a profound effect on the catalyst activity and ultimately FFA conversion is decreased. Moreover, long reaction time also weakens the bonding of the active group from the carbon surface and thus an increase in leaching of sulfonic groups adversely affects the catalyst activity [<xref rid="B41-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
