In order to confirm this, different temperatures range from 45 &#176;C to 70 &#176;C were used for the esterification of PFAD, keeping other parameters constant i.e., catalyst loading 4 wt %, methanol:PFAD molar ratio 9:1 and reaction time 90 min at 350 RPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02293-f007">Figure 7</xref>). It was observed that by rising temperature from 45 &#176;C to 65 &#176;C the FFA conversion improved from 35% to 97%. Temperatures above 65 &#176;C to 75 &#176;C showed negative impact and the end result was a decrease in FFA conversion from 97% to 94%. There are many reasons behind this decrease in FFA conversion after a certain limit. However, the most important one is the evaporation and bubbling out of methanol at a temperature higher than the boiling point of methanol which results in a continuous decrease in methanol content in the reaction mixture and thus sufficient methanol is not available for FFA conversion at temperatures more than the boiling point of methanol [<xref rid="B40-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
