Nevertheless, esterification is a reversible reaction and to move the equilibrium to the forward direction extra amounts of alcohol are required. In this study, several molar ratios (3:1 to 12:1) were tried to achieve maximum conversion of FFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02293-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In this case, 9:1 methanol to PFAD molar ratio was found to be the best ratio for maximum FFA conversion of PFAD of 97%. It was also noted that by enhancing the molar ratio from 9:1 to 12:1, a negative impact was observed and FFA conversion decreased from 97% to 89%. In an earlier study Mardhiah et al. [<xref rid="B4-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] observed highest FFA conversion at 12:1 and a negative impact on additional enhancement in molar ratio of methanol to oil. This negative impact produced by an increase in molar ratio of methanol to oil may be attributed to the deactivation of the catalyst due to hindering of the active groups on the surface of catalyst which ultimately shifted the equilibrium in the reverse direction. These observations are also in agreement with reported literature [<xref rid="B34-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. </p>
