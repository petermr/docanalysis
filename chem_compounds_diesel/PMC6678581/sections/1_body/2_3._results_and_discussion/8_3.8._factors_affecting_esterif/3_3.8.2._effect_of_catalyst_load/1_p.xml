<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The catalyst helps to increase the reaction rate by decreasing the activation energy of the process, and therefore, increasing the amount of catalyst surely speeds up the conversion of reactants into products [<xref rid="B36-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study, different catalyst concentration ranges from 2 wt % to 5 wt % was used for FFA conversion. It was noted that by raising the amount of catalyst the FFA conversion was also increased as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02293-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The peak FFA conversion was achieved at 4 wt % of catalyst, however, further increase in the catalyst amount showed negative effect and a reduction in FFA conversion was noted. It may probably be credited to the difference of mass transfer in between FFA content and catalyst active sites and therefore, excess amount of catalyst disturbed the reaction equilibrium [<xref rid="B37-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In earlier reported studies a similar trend was also observed, and the authors noted that, after a certain limit further increase in catalyst showed negative results [<xref rid="B38-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-materials-12-02293" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
