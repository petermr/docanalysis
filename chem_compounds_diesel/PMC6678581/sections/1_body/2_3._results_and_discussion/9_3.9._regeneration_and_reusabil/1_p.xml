<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The regeneration and reusability of STW was evaluated and the obtained results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-02293-f009">Figure 9</xref>. The esterification reaction was performed at catalyst loading of 4 wt %, methanol to PFAD ratio as 9:1, reaction temperature 65 &#176;C and reaction time 90 min. At the end of each run, the catalyst was recovered by filtration and washed with acetone followed by ethanol and distilled to purify it from all the trapped/adsorbed unwanted polar and non-polar compounds. It was observed that the STW catalyst could be used up to five consecutive runs without losing much activity. STW showed a FFA conversion of the PFAD from 96% to 68% after being reused for six times. This indicates that the STW catalyst works well until five cycles. The regeneration and reusability of STW catalyst showed that it has the potential to be used on a commercial scale. </p>
