The catalytic activity was studied to investigate the catalyst efficiency by studying the process optimization conditions. The optimization conditions revealed that the catalyst worked very well at a low temperature of 65 &#176;C, with catalyst loading of 4 wt %, by using 9:1 PFAD to methanol ratio for 90 min of reaction time and gave 97% FFA conversion. The STW catalyst characterization results revealed that it showed very high acid density, external thermal stability and a porous nature. Regeneration and reusability of STW catalyst shows very good results up to five cycles with good FFA conversion ability. This indicates that catalyst is feasible on a commercial scale because of its diverse properties i.e., it is inexpensive, works on lower temperature and can be used multiple times. The authors believe that the STW based solid acid catalyst is an appealing catalyst for PFAD conversion into esters. </p>
