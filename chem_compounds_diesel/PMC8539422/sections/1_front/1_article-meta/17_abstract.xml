<abstract xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>In this work, we analyzed the suitability of a versatile recombinant lipase, secreted by <italic toggle="yes">Ophiostoma piceae</italic> (OPEr) and produced in <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic>&#160;<italic toggle="yes">pastoris</italic>, as a catalyst of the synthesis of biodiesel. The enzyme was immobilized by five covalent procedures and by hydrophobicity on functionalized nanoparticles of magnetite or of a novel Zn/Mn oxide named G1. Then, they were tested for green production of biodiesel by solventless enzymatic transesterification of discarded cooking oil and methanol (1:4) at 25 &#176;C. The results were compared with those shown by free OPEr and the commercial lipases Eversa<sup>&#174;</sup> and Cal A<sup>&#174;</sup>. Several preparations with immobilized OPEr produced high synthesis yields (&gt;90% transesterification), comparable to those obtained with Eversa<sup>&#174;</sup>, the commercial enzyme designed for this application. Three of the biocatalysts maintained their catalytic efficiency for nine cycles. The process catalyzed by AMNP-CH-OPEr was scaled from 500 &#181;L to 25 mL (50 times), improving its efficiency.</p></abstract>
