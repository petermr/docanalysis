In these conditions, the reaction is biased to synthesis. The reaction is complex, since intermediate reaction products (diglycerides, monoglycerides) are released during transesterification, that occurs sequentially. To complete the reaction, three molecules of alcohol are required per triglyceride molecule, producing three molecules of esters and one of glycerol. Free fatty acids are also transformed into the corresponding esters by direct esterification, releasing a water molecule.</p>
