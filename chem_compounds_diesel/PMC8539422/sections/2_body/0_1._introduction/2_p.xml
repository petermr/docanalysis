<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Water-soluble lipases are homogeneous catalysts widely used for enzymatic transesterification, but its application at large-scale is hampered by the high cost of the biocatalyst, its low reusability, the need to be separated from the reaction products, and the limited stability of many enzymes in the presence of methanol [<xref rid="B9-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the development of heterogeneous biocatalysts in which the enzyme is made insoluble through its attachment to a solid support can help to solve some of these problems. A proper immobilization procedure may improve enzyme stability or specificity, reduce the possibility of being inhibited, provide operational flexibility, and eliminate downstream operations allowing a simple separation from the product, enabling its recovery and reuse, thus reducing operational costs [<xref rid="B9-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The carriers and techniques used for immobilization are varied [<xref rid="B10-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and it is important to keep in mind that the properties of the final biocatalyst rely on the interaction between the carrier, the enzyme, and the method for protein attachment [<xref rid="B17-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The techniques used for lipase immobilization include adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, encapsulation, and cross-linking [<xref rid="B6-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B18-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and there are not general rules to determine which are the optimal carrier and immobilization strategy for a determined enzyme and reaction [<xref rid="B12-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In general, the protein structure suffers changes during immobilization, thus it interesting to test several carriers and strategies to select the most efficient for the target application [<xref rid="B19-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Among the materials that can serve as immobilization carriers [<xref rid="B20-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], inorganic nanoparticles are attracting growing interest for their excellent behavior [<xref rid="B21-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and because particle size can be tailored attaining homogeneous and well-defined core-shell nanoparticles with a thick enzyme shell [<xref rid="B22-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Among these, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are very appreciated due to their high surface area, the availability of many hydroxyl groups that are easily modified facilitating a strong (covalent) binding of the enzyme, their high mechanical stability and low porosity that minimizes steric hindrances, and the easy separation of the biocatalyst from reaction mixtures by using an external magnetic field [<xref rid="B21-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Several lipases immobilized on silica-coated MNPs have proved to be versatile biocatalysts for biodiesel production [<xref rid="B9-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
