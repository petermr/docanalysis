<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Biodiesel is a non-toxic and biodegradable liquid fuel composed of long chain fatty acid alkyl esters with short chain alcohols, generally methanol and ethanol [<xref rid="B1-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The synthesis of these compounds can be driven by chemical or enzymatic catalysts, and industrial production is usually done by chemical transesterification of triglycerides, generally with alkaline catalysts [<xref rid="B2-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, in this reaction, soaps are produced, especially if the oil used contains free fatty acids, and this secondary reaction reduces biodiesel yields and makes the separation and purification of the products notably difficult [<xref rid="B3-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the contrary, the application of enzymatic methods also allows to synthesize esters from free fatty acids by direct esterification, increasing the total yields. Biodiesel production by lipase-catalyzed transesterification of sunflower oil and methanol was first reported three decades ago [<xref rid="B5-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Now, there is a tendency to use non-edible oils or urban wastes as sources of triglycerides, in order to fit within a circular economy scheme and to reduce the expense attributable to raw materials [<xref rid="B6-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which should not exceed 50% of production costs [<xref rid="B1-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similarly, solvent-free enzymatic bioprocesses are desirable both for environmental and economic reasons. Although the presence of a reaction solvent increases the solubility of oils and alcohol, reduces viscosity, and improves mass transfer [<xref rid="B7-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], solventless reactions are neat, facilitate easy separation, workup and purification, and minimize the production of waste [<xref rid="B8-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
