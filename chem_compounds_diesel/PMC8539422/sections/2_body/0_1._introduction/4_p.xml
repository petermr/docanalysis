<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Nevertheless, covalent immobilization has the advantage of irreversible binding of the protein to the support, avoiding leaching during the catalytic process [<xref rid="B10-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B18-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B28-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The existing protocols for covalent attachment are numerous and generally involve the side chains of different amino acids located in the protein surface which are not essential for its catalytic activity [<xref rid="B22-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and various active groups in the supports [<xref rid="B28-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Amino-functionalized carriers are widely used to this purpose, and they can be further activated with bifunctional reagents such as glutaraldehyde (GA), grafting reactive aldehyde groups in the carrier&#8217;s surface and allowing multipoint attachment of the protein [<xref rid="B25-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B29-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This versatile reagent is also generally used as cross linker for covalent immobilization as CLEAs (cross-linked enzyme aggregates) or mCLEAs (magnetic CLEAs, obtained including magnetic nanoparticles in the immobilization mixture) [<xref rid="B30-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, in the case of glycoproteins, the binding to the support can also be carried out through aldehyde groups obtained by soft chemical oxidation of the carbohydrate chain, and not through the peptide chain [<xref rid="B28-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This procedure has been scarcely used, although it leads to oriented enzyme immobilization on the carrier surface and high retention of lipase activity, compared with the same carrier activated with GA [<xref rid="B28-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B31-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
