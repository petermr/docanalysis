True lipolytic lipases experience the phenomenon of interfacial activation, that involves the transition from the inactive (closed) form of lipases to their active (open) configuration at an oil&#8211;water interface, leaving two highly hydrophobic regions exposed to the environment [<xref rid="B23-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, in the presence of hydrophobic materials like some immobilization carriers, this mechanism mediates the quick and simple adsorption of the protein [<xref rid="B12-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B24-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Triglyceride lipases are particularly sensitive to this phenomenon [<xref rid="B23-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and they are usually hyperactivated when immobilized on hydrophobic carriers which, in addition, is accompanied by enzyme stabilization and purification [<xref rid="B25-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, the use of a hydrophobic carrier avoids the adsorption of water and glycerol, which produces diffusional limitations for hydrophobic substrates [<xref rid="B4-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B14-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B27-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another mechanism used for specific adsorption of a protein to a carrier is ionic binding, in which the charged groups of the carrier interact with charged amino acid residues on the enzymes in the immobilization conditions, for example, the &#949;-amino groups of lysins or the carboxyl groups of glutamic and aspartic acids [<xref rid="B28-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
