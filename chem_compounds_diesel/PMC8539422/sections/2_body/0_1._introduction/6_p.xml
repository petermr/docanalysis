In the presence of water, the reaction can revert to hydrolysis, lowering product yields. The generally accepted mechanism of action for lipases is of the Ping-Pong Bi-Bi type, although several different models have been described to explain the transesterification of glycerides. The one-step model describes the direct alcoholysis of triglycerides, in which the alcohol is responsible for the breakdown and esterification of the released fatty acid. The two-step model requires the presence of some water: in a first phase, water hydrolyzes the triglyceride, and in the second stage, the fatty acids released are esterified. Canet et al. [<xref rid="B35-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reviewed the mechanisms described and proposed a new one that takes into account the presence of free fatty acids, confirming that both processes coexist. Andrade et al. [<xref rid="B36-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] corroborated that the process involves hydrolysis and synthesis reactions, with predominance of synthesis. Canet et al. [<xref rid="B35-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] also showed that polar molecules in the reaction medium, like free fatty acids, mono- and diacylglycerols, protect the enzyme by buffering the high polarity of methanol, improving the reaction rate and the stability of the biocatalyst.</p>
