The activity of the catalyst was determined monitoring at 410 nm the release of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-nitrophenol from hydrolysis of 1.5 mM <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-nitrophenyl butyrate (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>NPB, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 20 mM Tris&#8722;HCl pH 7.0 at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer. One unit of activity (1 U) is defined as the amount of enzyme used to release 1 &#956;mol of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-nitrophenol (&#949;<sub>410</sub> = 15,200 M<sup>&#8722;1</sup> cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) per minute under the defined conditions.</p>
