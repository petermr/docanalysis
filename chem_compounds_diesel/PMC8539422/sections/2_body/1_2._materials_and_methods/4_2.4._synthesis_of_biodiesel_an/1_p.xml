<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) was routinely evaluated in solvent-free reactions containing 500 &#956;L of cooking oil wastes, methanol (1:4 molar ratio), and 100 mg of the corresponding immobilized catalyst. Gas-chromatography analysis of the oil allowed the identification of triolein and other triglycerides as major components, although low amounts of the diglycerides 1,3-dioleoyl glycerol and 1-oleoyl-3-palmitoyl glycerol were also detected. The peak of free oleic acid was nearly undetectable, suggesting that the acid value of the oil was very low. Fatty acid composition was determined after chemical methanolysis of the oil sample (75% methyl oleate, 15% methyl palmitate and 9% methyl stearate). The vials were kept at 25 &#176;C with rotational agitation at 100 rpm in a mixer for 24 h. Methanol was added in three steps (0 h, 5 h, and 9 h). To evaluate the recyclability, the nanobiocatalysts were separated after each reaction cycle using an external magnet and washed with isooctane and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. The time course of the synthesis of biodiesel was monitored by gas chromatography, determining the production of methyl esters and the consumption of triglycerides at different times. The reactions were performed in duplicate. To assess the scalability of this approach, methanolysis reactions were performed with 5 g of AMNP-CH-OPEr in a final volume of 25 mL under the same reaction conditions.</p>
