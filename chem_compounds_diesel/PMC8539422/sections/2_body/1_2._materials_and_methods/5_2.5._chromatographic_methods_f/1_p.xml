The compounds detected were identified using commercial standards analyzed under identical conditions, or through their mass spectra using the NIST 2011 library and the ChemStation software (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The time course of the reactions was routinely monitored by gas chromatography (GC) in an Agilent 7890A with FID detection and a 5-m SPB-1 column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Aliquots of 15 &#181;L, containing 60 mM cholest-3-one as internal standard, were taken at 0, 5, 9 and 24 h, diluted with isooctane to a final volume of 300 &#181;L, and analyzed by GC using a multistep temperature program from 140 to 350 &#176;C.</p>
