<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The details on functionalization, protein immobilization, and characterization are given in Molina-Guti&#233;rrez et al. [<xref rid="B31-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B45-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In all cases, the immobilization yield (%) was calculated from the difference between offered activity and residual activity in the supernatant at the end of the immobilization period. The activity recovery was determined by considering the OPEr activity initially offered for immobilization and the activity of the immobilized catalyst. Both the residual activity in the supernatants after immobilization and the specific activity of the immobilized catalysts (mU/mg carrier) were determined as explained in <xref rid="sec2dot2-jof-07-00822" ref-type="sec">Section 2.2</xref>. The optimal amount of protein offered for immobilization (per mg of carrier: 1050 mU for SiMAG-octyl, 1500 mU for AMNP and 750 mU for AMNP-GA) was selected in preliminary tests as a compromise between immobilization yield and specific activity of the insoluble biocatalysts. For comparison, the commercial preparations of Eversa and Cal A were immobilized in one of the conditions tested for OPEr.</p>
