<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">According to the results in <xref rid="jof-07-00822-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the most successful immobilization methods were non-covalent deposition (SiMAG-octyl-OPEr) and mCLEAs. In both cases, the enzyme was immobilized in high yield, and the efficiency and recovered activity were also over 80%. Their specific activity was in the range of those measured for the two catalysts in which OPEr was attached through the carbohydrate chains (CH). However, the immobilization process was less efficient in the last, as deduced from their intermediate values of recovered activity and efficiency. Finally, immobilization of OPEr to GA-activated nanoparticles yielded the worst results, with low values for all the determined parameters. Nevertheless, the high immobilization efficiency value calculated for the AG1-GA-OPEr preparation suggests an hyperactivation of the immobilized enzyme.</p>
