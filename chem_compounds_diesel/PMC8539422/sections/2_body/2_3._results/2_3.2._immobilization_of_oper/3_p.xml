The success of immobilization is given by two parameters: the immobilization efficiency, that describes the percentage of bound enzyme activity that is observed in the immobilizate, and the recovered (or expressed) activity that compares the activity of the immobilizate to that of the total starting activity of the free enzyme [<xref rid="B15-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
