The immobilization parameters determined for the six heterogeneous biocatalysts prepared with OPEr are summarized in <xref rid="jof-07-00822-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The six nanobiocatalysts produced are active against <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>NPB, although the specific activity of those with the carrier activated with glutaraldehyde was around two to three times lower than the others, since the protein load accepted by this support was also much lower.</p>
