<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Four procedures that involve different regions of the protein were tested for OPEr immobilization. The covalent preparations were obtained by attaching the protein to two GA-activated supports, by preparation of mCLEAs with the AMNP-GA carrier, and by binding the (glyco)protein to the amino groups of the two aminated supports through aldehydes chemically generated in the carbohydrate (CH) chains of the enzyme (AMNP-CH and AG1-CH preparations). This is the only case in which the protein portion does not participate directly in binding [<xref rid="B50-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In addition, OPEr was also adsorbed on the hydrophobic SiMAG-octyl carrier.</p>
