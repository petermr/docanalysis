<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In FTIR spectra (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c), the band at 534 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is attributed to Mn-O vibrations, and the band around 636 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is related to spinel ZnMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> [<xref rid="B48-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the functionalized supports, the band at 1063 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> corresponds to the SiO-H groups. The band at 1647 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is intensified in the functionalized samples due to the N-H stretching vibrations of the free amino groups [<xref rid="B49-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. After silanization and functionalization with the APTS reagent, the average amount of amino groups incorporated to the G1 nanoparticles was 10.8 &#177; 3.4 &#956;mol/g of support, a value comparable to that determined for AMNPs [<xref rid="B45-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
