<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">G1 is a mixed oxide of Mn/Zn of high purity (95&#8211;96%). Its RXD pattern (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a) shows signals attributable to a tetragonal symmetry and a spinel-like structure, in accordance with the JCPDS database (No. 24-1133), with stoichiometry Zn<sub>0.25</sub>Mn<sub>2.75</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The observation of the G1 nanoparticles by TEM and SEM (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b,c) showed that, unlike the MNPs, their shape and size are not homogeneous, so it is impossible to give a value of their average diameter. In general, its size (&gt;50 nm) is larger than that of magnetic supports. The heterogeneity of these materials is expectable, since they were synthetized from a waste by a new, non-industrial process, without using any matrix for size or shape.</p>
