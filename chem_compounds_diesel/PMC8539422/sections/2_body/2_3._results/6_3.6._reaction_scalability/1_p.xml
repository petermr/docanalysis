Still at the laboratory level, we prepared AMNP-CH-OPEr in greater quantity and repeated the methanolysis process on a larger scale, to check if the good catalytic behavior and the simple handling of the reaction were maintained throughout the process. Although no lipase activity was detected in the supernatant after immobilization, the specific activity and recovery of activity determined for this batch were somewhat lower than those of a reaction with 1 g of AMNPs and 20 mg of protein, developed in parallel. The alcoholysis was successfully completed (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a,c), and the conversion of triglycerides to methyl esters was nearly full. This reaction was repeated three consecutive times, with little loss of activity (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>b).</p>
