In cases where a marked decrease in activity was observed in the fifth consecutive reaction, recycling was stopped. <xref rid="jof-07-00822-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> presents the percentage of triglycerides converted in each reaction cycle. It is interesting to note that, in the second reaction cycle (R2), all OPEr preparations, apart from AG1-GA-OPEr, slightly increased the biodiesel production yield. Except the variants immobilized on carriers activated with GA (regardless of if the naked material was magnetite or the Zn/Mn oxide), that lost more or less catalytic activity in this reaction after several reuses, the other nanobiocatalysts maintained almost 100% of their conversion activity after nine reaction cycles. The only preparation that experienced a clear loss of activity is AMNP-GA-OPEr (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b), which stopped working in the fifth cycle (R5), and AG1-GA-OPEr maintained 70% residual activity in R5 (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>e). Immobilization by non-covalent hydrophobic interaction (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a), as well as mCLEAs (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>f) and the covalent preparations that used the AMNP and AG1 carriers and the aldehydes generated in the sugar chains of the proteins (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c,d), preserved best the catalytic activity of OPEr in this reaction, although the AMNP-CH-OPEr biocatalyst seemed to be the most stable.</p>
