<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Eversa<sup>&#174;</sup> is the commercial enzyme designed by Novozymes for the synthesis of biodiesel. As such, it showed excellent behavior under these reaction conditions, both in its soluble and immobilized forms, converting the entire substrate into FAMEs (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a,b). However, the free enzyme produces around 60% of FAMEs after 9 h of reaction, while the immobilized form synthesized around 80% of biodiesel in the same period.</p>
