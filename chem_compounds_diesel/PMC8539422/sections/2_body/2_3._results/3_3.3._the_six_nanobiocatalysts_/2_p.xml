It can be observed that the immobilization of OPEr drastically increased its ability to synthetize biodiesel. The soluble enzyme (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a) produced 20% FAMEs in 24 h, while the reactions with immobilized enzyme yielded between 50&#8211;90% (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b&#8211;g), depending on the carrier and immobilization conditions. At this point, it is necessary to consider that, for technical reasons, these reactions contained 100 mg of each nanobiocatalyst, so the enzymatic dose is not uniform since the preparations had different specific activity (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This is especially relevant for AMNP-GA-OPEr, whose specific activity was between two and three times lower than that of the rest, justifying its reduced synthetic activity. The efficiency of this catalyst is likely to be comparable to that of the others if the catalytic dose were leveled. Leaving this preparation aside and considering the value of the calculated standard deviations, the results indicate that the activity of all nanobiocatalysts in the synthesis of FAMEs is similar.</p>
