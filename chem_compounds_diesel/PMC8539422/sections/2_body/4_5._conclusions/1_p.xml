<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Comparison of six heterogeneous biocatalysts with immobilized OPEr confirmed that both the carrier and the immobilization method strongly impact the efficiency of the enzyme and its suitability for a given bioprocess. Among the soluble enzymes evaluated, only Eversa Transform 2.0 produced biodiesel efficiently in the conditions tested, but the catalytic efficiency improved in all instances after immobilization. The best activity and recyclability in synthesis of biodiesel from oil wastes catalyzed by OPEr were obtained when the protein was immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles by hydrophobicity (which was not accompanied by OPEr hyperactivation), as mCLEAs, or through its oxidized sugar chains (AMNP-CH-OPEr), in which the activity loss in nine cycles was virtually negligible. The efficiency and operational stability of these biocatalysts with immobilized OPEr are comparable to those obtained for free or immobilized Eversa Transform 2.0, showing the biotechnological potential of the non-commercial enzyme. The outstanding enhancement of the stability of the immobilized OPEr contributes to the design of clean and sustainable production of biodiesel and supports its use in other bioprocesses of biotechnological relevance.</p>
