The robustness and efficiency of OPEr in this reaction improved markedly in five of the OPEr nanobiocatalysts, with synthesis yields between 75&#8211;92% (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and three of them maintained their catalytic efficiency for nine cycles (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Concerning the commercial catalysts, this is the first time that either Cal A or Eversa Transform 2.0 are immobilized through the aldehyde groups generated in their sugar chains. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports describing the immobilization of lipases by this procedure, except a previous paper from our group in which AMNP-CH-OPEr was successfully applied to synthetize stanol esters [<xref rid="B31-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The immobilized AMNP-CH-Eversa seemed to have a faster reaction rate as compared with the free form, and the efficiency of AMNP-CH-Cal A improved considerably with respect to the free enzyme. In the best OPEr catalysts, the yield of FAMEs and the operational stability are slightly lower to those observed for Eversa<sup>&#174;</sup>.</p>
