<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In this work, we decided to use environmentally friendly conditions for the enzymatic methanolysis of triglycerides from oil wastes, without consuming energy (25 &#176;C) or unnecessary organic solvents. In the conditions assayed, the soluble lipases OPEr and Cal A displayed low efficiency synthetizing biodiesel. The presence in the reaction medium of around 10% buffer in which the enzyme is dissolved can influence the performance of alcoholisis [<xref rid="B18-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, when the enzyme is immobilized, most water can be removed after dispensing the biocatalyst in the reaction vial. On the contrary, the reactions catalyzed by free Eversa<sup>&#174;</sup> reached completion regardless of the water content, highlighting the extreme efficiency of this biocatalyst specifically designed for this application by Novozymes. This product, launched on the market in 2014, was advertised as the first enzymatic solution for the synthesis of biodiesel from waste oils [<xref rid="B62-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>
