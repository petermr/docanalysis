<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">There are many articles published on the use of lipases immobilized on different supports for the synthesis of biodiesel, using or not cosolvents and water capture systems, and under various conditions and reaction times. The amount of biocatalyst used is also highly variable, and for lipases immobilized on AMNPs, these percentages are usually between 17.3&#8211;40% (<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>) [<xref rid="B63-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This disparity of conditions makes it difficult to compare the data described in the bibliography with those presented in this work. For this reason, one of the methods was chosen to immobilize the two commercial lipases with the objective of comparing the activity of OPEr in the same reaction conditions. The free form of the lipase Cal A<sup>&#174;</sup> has been reported to catalyze the synthesis of biodiesel from waste frying palm oil [<xref rid="B37-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The maximum FAMEs yield (94.6 &#177; 1.4%) was achieved under reaction conditions optimized by RSM: 16.6 wt% water content and 5.5 wt% lipase load at 30 &#176;C for 22 h.</p>
