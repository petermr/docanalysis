<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Many publications describe the application of soluble Eversa<sup>&#174;</sup> in synthesis of biodiesel, but, as it is a low-cost enzyme, the interest in its immobilization is limited. The study of Remonatto et al. [<xref rid="B38-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] evaluated the activity of Eversa immobilized on four hydrophobic supports in alcoholysis of sunflower oil. The authors observed the total conversion of the oil into methyl esters in short times, but the reactions were developed at 40 &#176;C with hexane as co-solvent and in strict anhydrous conditions. Although the enzyme immobilized on Sepabeads-C18 produced esters in a short time, its stability against methanol was very poor, maintaining the activity for three cycles and preserving 75% in the fourth. Therefore, our results with the covalent preparation of Eversa<sup>&#174;</sup> make a clear difference in terms of the recyclability of this enzyme after immobilization. Other works report the non-covalent immobilization of Eversa in agarose beads functionalized with octyl or aminated groups and their use in hydrolysis reactions [<xref rid="B43-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and the synthesis of mCLEAs-Eversa to produce biolubricants [<xref rid="B40-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
