<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">On the contrary, despite hyperactivation of several lipases immobilized by interfacial adsorption on hydrophobic carriers being described a long time ago [<xref rid="B57-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the parameters calculated for SiMAG-octyl-OPEr (immobilization efficiency&#8212;82%; immobilization yield&#8212;99%; recovered activity&#8212;80%) do not show any hyperactivation of the enzyme, confirming previous findings [<xref rid="B58-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. According to Derewenda et al., the activation of lipases at an oil&#8211;water interface is a unique property which is evolved in response to the problem of handling insoluble substrates, and it distinguishes true lipolytic proteins from esterases which act upon soluble esters [<xref rid="B23-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The increase of the lipolytic activity has usually been related to the displacement of the lid [<xref rid="B59-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, in spite of having lids that must be opened to allow the access to the active center, hyperactivation has not been observed either in OPEr or in the isoforms CRL3 and CRL4 of <italic toggle="yes">Candida rugosa,</italic> which are structurally similar to OPEr and possess relevant esterase activity [<xref rid="B58-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition, two of them are dimeric (there is not information on the tertiary structure of CRL4), with their lid participating to a greater or lesser extent in dimer formation [<xref rid="B61-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], which may also help to explain this behavior.</p>
