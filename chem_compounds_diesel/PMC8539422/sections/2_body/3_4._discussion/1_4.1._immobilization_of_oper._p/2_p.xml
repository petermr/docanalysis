<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Most immobilization methods involve the interaction of specific areas of the peptide chain with the reactive groups placed in the scaffold&#8217;s surface. Thus, depending on the reactivity of these groups, different regions of the peptide chain will be involved in the attachment. However, only few amino acids can mediate this binding thanks to their reactivity (<xref rid="jof-07-00822-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), and the participation of one or the other will depend on the scaffold composition, the functional groups placed on its surface, and the conditions in which the immobilization is carried out [<xref rid="B28-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
