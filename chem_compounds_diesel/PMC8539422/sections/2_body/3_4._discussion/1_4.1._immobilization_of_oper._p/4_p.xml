<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As observed in <xref rid="jof-07-00822-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, all the catalysts with immobilized OPEr hydrolyzed the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>NPB used as a model substrate, confirming that they were active. As previously noticed, the specific activity of those with the carrier activated with glutaraldehyde was lower than the others, since the protein load accepted by this support was also much lower. In addition, the data show that the specific activity determined for the enzyme immobilized on AG1 and AG1-GA in this reaction was higher than those calculated for the analogous magnetic supports (AMNP and AMNP-GA). The parameters determined for AG1-GA-OPEr suggest that the protein is hyperactivated when immobilized in these conditions, since the immobilization efficiency is 126% while the immobilization yield (43%) and recovered activity (41%) are low. The reasons that justify this behavior merit further investigation. These results demonstrate that not only the surface groups of the support affect enzyme activity, but also its chemical composition, and confirm the importance of biocatalyst engineering in order to select the most suitable for a given application [<xref rid="B15-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B56-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
