If the activity of the enzyme resists this process, the immobilized biocatalyst is often more stable than the free enzyme, can be easily separated from the reaction mixture facilitating the purification of the products, and can be reused [<xref rid="B15-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B28-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B51-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-jof-07-00822" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, it is not easy to predict which of the multiple immobilization carriers and methods will be best suited to produce a robust biocatalyst for a given application, and the usual approach is that of trial and error. Here we have tested two types of inorganic nanoparticles as basal scaffolds: magnetite and a novel Zn/Mn oxide produced from recycled batteries denominated G1 and used as immobilization carrier for the first time.</p>
