<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Comparing <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>Ia,Ib, one can see the three main operational advantages when Oligocat is applied to biodiesel synthesis, where the first advantage is to obtain, directly, alkyl esters &#8220;ready to go&#8221; to be validated through ASTM D6751 and EN 14214:2003, where there is no need for pH correction as well as no need to remove water content, as usual homogeneous catalysts require. Still, one can see that with Oligocat, it is not necessary to wait for the phase separation between alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerol, after evaporation of the alcohol at the reaction system, the alkyl esters can be directly stored. In <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>II, one can observe the straightforward separation of the alkyl esters phase due to the pseudo-homogeneous property for this class of catalysts.</p>
