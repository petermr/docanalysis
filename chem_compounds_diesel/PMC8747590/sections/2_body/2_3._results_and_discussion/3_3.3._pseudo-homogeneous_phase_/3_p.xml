<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In common reaction systems with other kinds of catalysts, glycerol is usually separated by the gravity or centrifugation processes, which is time-consuming. With P24 or POS catalysts, the generated glycerol is no longer needed to be separated from the product reaction. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref> presents the comparison of the usual conversion of triacylglycerol reactions and the conversion applying Oligocat catalysts.</p>
