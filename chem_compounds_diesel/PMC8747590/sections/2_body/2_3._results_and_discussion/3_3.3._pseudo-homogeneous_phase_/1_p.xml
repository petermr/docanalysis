P24 and POS catalysts sequester the glycerol molecules generated as a subproduct of triacylglycerol conversion to alkyl esters. To better comprehend such an effect, <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> presents the molecular structures of P24, POS, glycerol, and the product phase.</p>
