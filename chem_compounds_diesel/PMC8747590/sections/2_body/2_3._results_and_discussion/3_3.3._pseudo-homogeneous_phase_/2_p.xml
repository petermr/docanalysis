<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>, the Oligocat POS and P24 molecular structures are presented, where the polymeric backbones have an average molar mass of 3.909 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> Da&#8729;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and, as mentioned previously, are functionalized with 67.3% in mass of sulfonic groups to give the catalytic properties. Coefficients in POS and P24 represent the calculated degree of polymerization, taking into account the ratio of functionalized and non-functionalized monomeric units. The high polarity given by SO<sub>3</sub>H groups and the short polymeric chains can explain the good solubility of the catalysts in the alcohol phase in the initial stages of biodiesel synthesis. Nevertheless, after ending the reaction, and with the excess of alcohol being evaporated, Oligocat interacts strongly with the glycerol phase. Glycerol and Oligocat mixture present high viscosity and adheres to the reactor walls, giving the pseudo-homogenous property of Oligocat, where initially it is soluble in the alcohol phase and, afterward, together with glycerol, a viscous phase is formed and remains completely separated from the liquid states phases.</p>
