<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Oligocat catalysts were evaluated applying the optimal experimental reaction conditions presented in the previous section and, afterward, compared with the Lewatit SPC 112 as a reference catalyst. Reagents applied were tallow swine and used sauteing oil as triacylglycerol sources, using methanol and ethanol as reagent alcohols. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref> presents the investigated reagents and ratio conversions to alkyl esters. All conversion rates are averaged duplicates.</p>
