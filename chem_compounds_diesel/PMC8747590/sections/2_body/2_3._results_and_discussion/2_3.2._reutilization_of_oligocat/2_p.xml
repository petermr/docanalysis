<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Oligocat catalysts were evaluated in comparison with Lewatit SPC 112 regarding the conversion of alkyl esters. Catalysts POS and P24S presented better efficiency for the optimized experimental reactional conditions, and PPS catalyst does not present significant rate conversions. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> depicts conversion rates of Oligocat POS and P24S catalysts and the minimum conversion rate imposed by ASTM D6751.</p>
