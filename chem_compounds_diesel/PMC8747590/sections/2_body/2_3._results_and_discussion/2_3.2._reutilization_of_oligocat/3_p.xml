<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Oligocat P24S presented a sufficient conversion rate of alkyl esters, and the final product can be classified as biodiesel, either with ethanol or methanol, and applying tallow swine as a triacylglycerol source. Regarding sauteing oil as a triacylglycerol source, although conversion rates in the range of 90% were achieved, no catalysts were capable of complying with ASTM D6751. Interesting to note was the higher conversion rates achieved with ethanol when compared with methanol experiments. Oligocat POS and P24 were afterward evaluated in at least three cycles of reutilization. After purification of the catalyst (separation of glycerol by a conventional column filled with silica), the resultant material was evaluated by FTIR and compared with the mixture glycerol/catalyst [<xref rid="B38-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> present the FTIR spectra of Oligocat P24 and glycerol mixture (before purification) and FTIR spectra of Oligocat P24 purified.</p>
