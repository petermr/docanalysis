<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, one can see the conversion rate of triacylglycerols to alkyl esters, measured through GPC, which the results reflect the comparison of alkyl esters peak area and the sum of peak areas for tri, di, and monoacylglycerols. One can note a better output in rection 16. Nevertheless, the 65% conversion rate is not sufficient to classify the products as biofuel. In order to label an organic matrix as biofuel, it is necessary to follow the given physico&#8211;chemical characteristics from ASTM D6751, and, among other parameters, a minimum rate of 96.5% in mass composition for alkyl esters shall be achieved in the final product. In literature, the conversion rates are sought in the range from 95 to 99% [<xref rid="B36-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> presents the yield and conversion rate from the factorial planning.</p>
