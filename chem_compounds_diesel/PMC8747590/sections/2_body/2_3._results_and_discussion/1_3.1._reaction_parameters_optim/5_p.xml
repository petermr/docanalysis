<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>, observing the first order of synergy, one can see a strong positive effect from the variable&#8217;s time, followed by the catalyst, and a slight positive effect of the temperature. The molar ratio presented no significant influence in the reactional system. The positive influence of the time, catalyst, and temperature is represented in Experiment 12, with a longer reaction time, high catalyst concentration, and high temperature, resulting in a conversion of 62.7 (&#177;2.3)%, and Experiment 16, with the conversion of 65.6 (&#177;2.3)%. Secondary effects of the variables were significant for temperature correlated &#215; time, catalyst &#215; molar ratio, and catalyst &#215; time. Although the molar ratio does not present the first order of influence, it is interesting to note the strong influence of molar ratio &#215; catalyst.</p>
