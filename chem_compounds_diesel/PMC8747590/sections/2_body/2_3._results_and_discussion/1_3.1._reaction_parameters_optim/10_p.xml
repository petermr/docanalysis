<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Reactions 23 and 25 presented a conversion rate above the minimum standard for alkyl esters determined by ASTM D6751, which is 96.5% alkyl esters in the mass composition of the final product. ESD for this experiment was &#177;1.9%, resulting in statistically equal values for reactions 23 and 25. In this case, reaction 23 was chosen as the optimal reaction parameter, which uses fewer amounts of alcohol for the molar ratio variable.</p>
