In (A), one can see an improvement in the conversion rate for all geometric points from (&#8722;) to (+) level of temperature variable (indicated by the arrows). Similar behavior is observed in (B), where all geometric points presented a better conversion rate when the catalyst is used at the (+) level. Interestingly, for the molar ratio variable, going from the (&#8722;) to (+) level does not significantly improve the conversion rate. Two of the four geometrical points presented statistical equal values, and one of them presented poor conversion when compared with the (&#8722;) level. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> represents the optimal conversion rates of alkyl esters regarding the studied 2<sup>3</sup> factorial planning.</p>
