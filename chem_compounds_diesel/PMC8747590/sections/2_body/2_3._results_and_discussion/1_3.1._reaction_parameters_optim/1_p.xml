To remind, the maximum content of 0.5% in mass of FFAs is the limit to label triacylglycerol sources as a non-acidic raw matrix. For this purpose, tallow swine and used sauteing oil were investigated as potential candidates to be the raw matrix of our studies. The AOCS Ca 5a-40 method was followed to determine the acidity of those materials, and <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> presents the averaged triplicates of the results.</p>
