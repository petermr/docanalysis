On the other side, the conversion parameter represents only the percentage of obtained alkyl esters. Although a high yield rate was observed for the majority of experiments, presenting values higher than 90% for most of the cases, a low conversion rate was achieved, where the best result was approximately 65% of alkyl ester product. To better understand the reactional system, a synergic analysis of the variables was calculated, and a central point triplicate reaction was carried out to generate the standard deviation for the reactional system. A value of &#177;2.3% of conversion was obtained. Afterward, all variables were correlated in the first, second, and third levels of synergism. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> represents the results of the calculation.</p>
