Nevertheless, the conversion rate of 66 (&#177;2.3) or 63 (&#177;2.3)% are statistically equal when ESP is considered. Still, the obtained alkyl esters cannot be classified as biodiesel, as ASTM D6751 determines [<xref rid="B29-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To optimize conversion rates, reaction conditions were investigated at the boundaries of reaction 12, which in <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> is represented by the geometrical point in a turquoise-color circle. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref> presents investigated reaction conditions.</p>
