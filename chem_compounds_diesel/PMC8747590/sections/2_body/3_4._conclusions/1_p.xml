As literature evidenced, higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are produced by biodiesel obtained from first-generation feedstock, which is roughly three times higher than petroleum diesel, considering GLOBIUM and ILUC factors. Larger land-farming areas are needed if one is to remain in biodiesel produced from first-generation feedstock.</p>
