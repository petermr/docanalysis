<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our effort in this work was to develop an acid catalyst designed for second-generation feedstock, named here as Oligocat. Through factorial planning, the biodiesel synthesis was optimized for Oligocat catalysts. POS and P24 catalysts were able to provide high conversion yields of TAG&#8217;s to FA(X)E, allowing them to be classified as biodiesel according to this parameter, which is given by ASTM D6751 and EN 14214:2003. High conversion yields above 96.5 wt% of FA(X)E were obtained applying tallow swine as feedstock, with both methanol and ethanol. For sauteing oil, using ethanol, it was possible to achieve a conversion rate in the range of 90%. A significant advantage of Oligocat is its pseudo-homogeneous property that resulted in the reduction of the operational steps for biodiesel synthesis workflow. Oligocat acts initially as a homogenous catalyst, having an optimal mass transfer of the active catalytic groups to the reaction medium. With the course of chemical reaction, Oligocat sequesters glycerol, generating a strong viscous phase, which does not interact with the biodiesel phase, resulting in fewer purification and separation steps for the biodiesel process production. With Oligocat being applied as a catalyst, there is no need to post-process the biodiesel phase. After the evaporation of the alcohol in excess from the reaction medium, Oligocat generates a biodiesel &#8220;ready to go&#8221;. The time-consuming separation phases between FA(X)E and glycerol is no longer needed. Oligocat was reutilized at least three times for biodiesel synthesis, where conversion yields above the minimum value required by ASTM D6751 and EN 14214:2003 were obtained.</p>
