It reduces the FA(X)E conversion yield, mainly due to emulsification of the biphasic system, making it difficult to obtain a pure and high content of FA(X)E. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> [<xref rid="B26-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] depicts the saponification reaction.</p>
