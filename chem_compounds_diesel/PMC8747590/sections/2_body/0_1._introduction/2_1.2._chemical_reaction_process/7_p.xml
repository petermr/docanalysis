<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As the main message from <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, alkali catalysis requires strict control of the feedstock. Talley (2004) pointed out that feedstock costs for alkali catalysis can represent 60 to 75% of the final biodiesel price [<xref rid="B32-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In acidic mediums, conversion yields above the minimum given by ASTM and EN specifications can be achieved with longer reaction times when compared with alkali medium, which is explained by the different reaction mechanisms. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> present generic mechanisms for basic and acid catalytic systems.</p>
