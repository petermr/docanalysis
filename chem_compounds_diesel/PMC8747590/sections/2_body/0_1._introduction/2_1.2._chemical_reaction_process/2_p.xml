If the catalyst is soluble in one of these phases, the system is considered homogeneous. Nevertheless, if a catalyst is insoluble in both phases, the system is considered heterogeneous. The choice of the homogeneous or heterogeneous catalytic system, being alkali or acid, plays a major role and generates operational advantages and disadvantages depending on the feedstock generation. Parameters such as reaction time, the molar ratio between alcohol and feedstock, temperature, production cost, and type of catalyst are examples that are dependent on the feedstock physical&#8211;chemical properties [<xref rid="B22-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
