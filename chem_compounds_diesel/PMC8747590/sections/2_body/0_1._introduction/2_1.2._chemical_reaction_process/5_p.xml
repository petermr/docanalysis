As a quantified example, alkali medium catalytic systems shall be conducted with FFAs at a maximum of 0.5 wt% [<xref rid="B23-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B29-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Important to mention as well as is the water content of the feedstock, which cannot exceed 0.3 wt% if basic catalysis is applied. Excess of water will cause hydrolyzation of the FA(X)E, leading to fatty acids and consequently being converted into carboxylic salts in basic medium, as <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> depicts:</p>
