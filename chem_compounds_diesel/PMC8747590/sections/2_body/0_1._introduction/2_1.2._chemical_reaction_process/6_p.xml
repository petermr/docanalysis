<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Kinetics of transesterification reaction is favored in alkali medium, being approximately four-thousand times faster than acidic catalysis, which is also one of the reasons for its application at industrial scale. Consequently, the same yield conversion can be achieved in acidic catalysis with significantly longer reaction times [<xref rid="B23-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B30-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents the main characteristics of alkali and acidic mediums for transesterification reaction of TAG&#8217;s to FA(X)E.</p>
