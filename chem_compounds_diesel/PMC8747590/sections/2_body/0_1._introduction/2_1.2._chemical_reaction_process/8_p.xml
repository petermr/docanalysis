In the acid mechanism, the carbonyl group has to be firstly activated by the catalyst, and afterwards, it reacts with the alcohol. In the basic mechanism, the carbonyl group reacts instantly with the alcoxy group. The alcoxy group is formed from the reaction of alcohol and catalyst, which has a faster kinetic. Some authors approached the basic mechanism for biodiesel synthesis with more detail. Dijkstra et al. (2008) suggested the formation of enolates as intermediate steps, which would increase the reaction kinetics, as <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> depicts [<xref rid="B30-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B33-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]:</p>
