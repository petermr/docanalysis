<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">UFOP (Union zur F&#246;rderung von Oel&#8212;Und Proteinpflanzen E.V.) presented an overview of the different feedstocks applied for biodiesel production, where still circa 75% of the global production is carried out using first-generation feedstock, with 34% from palm, 26% from soybean and 16% from rapeseed oils. Second-generation feedstock represents 18% of total global production, with 11% coming from sauteing oil and 7% from animal fats [<xref rid="B11-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], data are from 2019. Importantly, also to be considered is the higher demand of biodiesel nowadays. If biodiesel is continuously being produced from first-generation feedstock, larger areas of land farming will be necessary to supply this market. For example, UFOP has registered the German internal production of biodiesel since the 1990s decade, where production in 1995 was 35 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> Tons, and in 2019 it reached 2.348 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> Tons, an expressive increase in production volume in the last 24 years [<xref rid="B12-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
