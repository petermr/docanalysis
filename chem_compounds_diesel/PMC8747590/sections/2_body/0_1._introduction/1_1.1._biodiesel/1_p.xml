Non-renewable energies such as oil, coal and gas represent more than 80% of the total global energy consumption [<xref rid="B3-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several prospections have shown that the energy demand on the planet tends to increase substantially. For example, in the decade of 2030, demand for energy is projected to increase by more than 50% in comparison with the 2000s [<xref rid="B4-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In order to reduce mainly petroleum as raw material for energy production, the usage of renewable sources might play a decisive role, which nowadays presents a humble share of 16% of the total energy consumption on our planet [<xref rid="B5-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One of the derivate products from petroleum, the diesel fraction, can be replaced by an attractive and potentially cost-effective renewable source: biodiesel.</p>
