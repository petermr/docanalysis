If one considers the entire process chain, including cultivation, harvesting, extraction and conversion to biodiesel, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are higher than petroleum diesel. As mentioned by the European Federation for Transport and Environment in one of its latest reports, since 2011, EU drivers have burned 39 Mt of biodiesel from palm and soy, emitting circa 381 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> eq (including ILUC emissions from GLOBIUM model). This CO<sub>2</sub> amount is roughly three times more if the same amount of petroleum diesel is used. The last decade presented a negative impact from biodiesel, which is produced in its majority from first-generation feedstock [<xref rid="B13-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notes: EU&#8212;European Union; RED&#8212;Renewable Energy Directive; ILUC&#8212;Indirect Land Use Change; GLOBIUM&#8212;Global Biosphere Management Model.
