To date, a broad range of feedstocks have been studied in the literature, for example, almost any kind of vegetable oil, microalgae, waste sauteing oil and animal fats. Nevertheless, biodiesel still presents a higher cost when compared with diesel fuel. One of the main reasons is the utilization of edible oil sources as feedstock for its production, which is dependent on the competition with prices from the food industry, eventually resulting in feedstock trading not favorable for biodiesel production. Nevertheless, this feedstock presents the best physical&#8211;chemical properties to be applied as raw material for biodiesel production. In order to avoid the high costs of feedstock, an approach with considerable potential is the utilization of non-edible feedstock sources, for example, waste oils, animal fats and greases [<xref rid="B1-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In literature, feedstock for biodiesel production is classified into four generations, as presented in <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> [<xref rid="B4-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
