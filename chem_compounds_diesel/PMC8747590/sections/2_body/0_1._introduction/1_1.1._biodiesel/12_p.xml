Reaction parameters were extensively studied in order to provide a conversion yield higher than 96.5 wt% at the first reaction cycle. To better comprehend the chemical design and optimization of Oligocat, the next section explores briefly the important characteristics that will guide the system of biodiesel production.</p>
