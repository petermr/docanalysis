<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The broadest definition of biodiesel is given by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), which establishes biodiesel as mono alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from renewable lipid feedstocks, such as vegetable oil or animal fat [<xref rid="B7-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Within ASTM definition, the acronym FAME is the convention as fatty acid methyl esters, which represents the conversion product of any kind of feedstock source using methanol as an alkylation reagent. Precisely, ASTM D6751 standardizes the physical&#8211;chemical parameters that one has to comply with in order to label FAME as biodiesel. Chemically, biodiesel is simply a mono alkyl ester of a long chain structure that fulfills the quality control demanded by ASTM D6751. <xref rid="polymers-14-00210-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> presents the general reaction for biodiesel production.</p>
