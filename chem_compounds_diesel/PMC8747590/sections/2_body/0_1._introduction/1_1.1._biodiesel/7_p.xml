The second generation of feedstock is fundamentally any triacylglycerol source with low commercial value, which presents, as well, the advantage of not competing with the food industry [<xref rid="B3-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The third generation of feedstock is based on microalgae biomass technology, including the entire process chain, from cultivation and harvesting to triacylglycerol extraction, purification, and, finally, the conversion of TAG&#8217;s to FA(X)E. Usual microalgae species for biodiesel production include <italic toggle="yes">Nannochloropsis</italic> sp., <italic toggle="yes">Chlorella</italic> sp., <italic toggle="yes">Scenedesmus</italic> sp., <italic toggle="yes">Pavlova lutheri</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Iso-chrysis</italic> sp. [<xref rid="B10-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The fourth generation of feedstock is in an initial-phase of research, being oriented to carbon storage and capture, taking advantage of bio-engineered plants or algae [<xref rid="B8-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Singh et al. 2021, describes the fourth generation biodiesel feedstock as a combination of three technologies; (i) through purpose-designed photosynthetic microorganism, (ii) through the production combination of photovoltaics and microbial fuel, and/or (iii) through synthetic cell production [<xref rid="B4-polymers-14-00210" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
