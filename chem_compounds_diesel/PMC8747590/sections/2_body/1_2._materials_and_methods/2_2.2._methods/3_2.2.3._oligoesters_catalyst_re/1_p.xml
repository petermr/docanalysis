Ethanol (PA) was used as an eluent phase (15 mL). A mixture of catalyst and glycerol was separated at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The material remaining in the eluent was dried (60 &#176;C until constant weight) and acidulated with hydrochloric acid 0.1 mol&#183;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> solution, washed with water until neutral pH, and once more dried until constant weight.</p>
