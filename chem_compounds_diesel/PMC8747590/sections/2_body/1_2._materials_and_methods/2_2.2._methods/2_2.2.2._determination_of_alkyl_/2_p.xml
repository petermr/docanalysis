Concentration range for all compounds were from 0.25 to 8.0 mg&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, as follows: 0.25; 0.5; 1.0; and from 1.0 to 8.0, in steps of 1.0 mg&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, using THF (suitable for HPLC, &#8805;99.9%) as solvent. Afterward, all samples were weighed in the range from 2.0 to 6.0 mg&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, using THF (suitable for HPLC, &#8805;99.9%) as solvent.</p>
