The reaction was carried out at 40&#160;&#176;C at 200&#160;rpm. Aliquots were taken at different intervals and analysed by GC. The reaction was carried out in duplicates and the error within each set was within &#177;3%.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0330">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig>
