The enzyme (1.4&#160;U/&#160;g of oil) was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (with or without 40&#160;mM OG) and then precipitated in different organic solvents (chilled, 4&#160;mL) at 4&#160;&#176;C and 200&#160;rpm and shaken for 30&#160;min. The precipitate obtained was washed twice with the chilled precipitant and then a final wash with chilled ethanol in each case (1&#160;mL each time). 0.5&#160;mg oil was used for the reaction and 140&#160;&#956;L ethanol was added so that oil: ethanol ratio is 1:4. 20% (w/w) silica and 2% (w/w) water was added. The reaction was carried out at 40&#160;&#176;C at 200&#160;rpm. Aliquots were taken at different intervals and analysed by GC. The reaction was carried out in duplicates and the error within each set was within &#177;4%.</p></caption>
