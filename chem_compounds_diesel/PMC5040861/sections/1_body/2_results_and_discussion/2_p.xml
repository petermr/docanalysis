Lipases have been shown to work well with oils with high free fatty acid (FFA) content <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and crude oils like oil extracted from spent coffee grounds <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Among the plant oils, soybean oil has been preferred in the U.S. <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The first pilot plant producing biodiesel has been operating in China using lipase and utilizes soybean oil as the renewable raw material <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The synthesis of biodiesel from soybean oil and ethanol using EPROS of TLL (28&#160;U/g of oil) and EPROS prepared in the presence of Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and N-octyl-&#946;-D-glucopyranoside (OG) is shown in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. A 67% conversion to ethyl esters was obtained in 7&#160;h when EPROS was used as the biocatalyst. TLL is reported to be a 1,3 specific enzyme. Hence, transesterification of only 2 out of the 3 fatty acids on the glycerol backbone is expected. Hence, 67% conversion represents complete conversion in terms of theoretically expected conversion. It has however been reported that acyl migration from position 2&#8211;1 or 3 on the glycerol chain can take place <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This acyl migration can be spontaneous and is also facilitated under certain conditions. Hence, in many cases, transesterification reactions catalysed by 1,3 specific lipases have been reported to exceed their expected conversion <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Also, as pointed out by Schneider <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, one should view these specificities as relative specificities and not as absolute specificities. <italic>Candida antarctica</italic> lipase B, in fact, also has been sometime reported as a 1,3 specific lipase <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> but often has been observed to function like a non specific lipase <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. When the enzyme precipitates bioimprinted with CTAB (0.05%) or OG (40&#160;mM) were used, 78% and 80% conversions to biodiesel were obtained respectively (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
