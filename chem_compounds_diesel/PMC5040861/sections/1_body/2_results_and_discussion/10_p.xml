<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We have already shown that non edible oils from Karanja (Latin name is <italic>Pongamia milletia</italic>, generally known as Pongamia) and spent coffee grounds can be converted to biodiesel by enzymatic route <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Also, esters for other applications such as biolubricants <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and fragrances have been made using the enzymatic catalysis. Hence, the strategy used here should be useful in diverse applications where oils/fats can be converted to various value added products.</p>
