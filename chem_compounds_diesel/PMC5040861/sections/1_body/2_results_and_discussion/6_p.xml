<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Presumably the <italic>in situ</italic> bioimprinting of the alcohol substrate made the EPROS prepared with ethanol more efficient in the synthesis of biodiesel. Further, dual imprinting using a surfactant to open up the lid prior to precipitation was also tried. In all the three cases, bioimprinting with the surfactant made a marked difference in the conversions. However, the dually bioimprinted TLL made by precipitation in the substrate alcohol (in the presence of 40&#160;mM OG) was the best catalyst giving 98% conversion to biodiesel in 48&#160;h whereas the others with propanol and <italic>tert</italic>-butanol gave 68% and 59% respectively (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus a very economical process, using very low amount of enzyme (only 2% w/w of the oil), could be developed for the synthesis of biodiesel by using the dual bioimprinting procedure in case of lipases.</p>
