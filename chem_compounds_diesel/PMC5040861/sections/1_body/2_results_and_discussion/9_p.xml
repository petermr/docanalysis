<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Recently Nordblad et al. <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> have carried out identification of critical parameters in the biodiesel production from rapeseed oil using another liquid formulation of TLL called Callera Trans L. Although that study has been done using a biphasic system with methanol, it provides a valuable approach for optimizing enzyme catalysed biodiesel production. In their studies, the enzyme load varied from 0.2&#8211;0.5% (w/w oil) and typical reaction times were 24&#160;h.</p>
