Biodiesel is synthesized by the transesterification of oil and an alcohol, in this case, ethanol. Thus ethanol as a substrate was decided to be tried as an <italic>in situ</italic> bioimprinting agent for TLL. In this case precipitation of TLL (1.4&#160;U/g of oil) was carried out using three different short chain alcohols, propanol, <italic>tert</italic>-butanol and ethanol (in the absence of the surfactant OG/CTAB). The EPROS was then used for the transesterification reaction. It is to be noted that the enzyme load here was very low (1.4&#160;U/g of oil) to see the effect of bioimprinting. At higher enzyme load, all preparations would give high conversions very fast and the effect of bioimprinting with alcohols would be masked. When EPROS was made using ethanol, which was also the alcohol substrate in this reaction, a 99% conversion in 96&#160;h was obtained whereas the EPROS with propanol and <italic>tert</italic>-butanol gave only 65% and 50% conversion respectively (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
