<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In the present work, to make the process more economical, even lower enzyme load was tried (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Even 14&#160;U of TLL/g of oil bioimprinted with OG or CTAB could yield 98% biodiesel in 4&#160;h (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and 7&#160;U/g of oil yielded &#8764;85% in the same time (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The corresponding EPROS could give 81% and 72% respectively. Bioimprinted TLL proved to be a better catalyst than the simple enzyme precipitate for biodiesel synthesis.</p>
