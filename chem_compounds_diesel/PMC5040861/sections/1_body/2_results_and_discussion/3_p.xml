<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Silica is known to facilitate acyl migration <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It is inexpensive and an abundantly available material. It is also considered as a green material <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Hence 20% (w/w of oil) silica was added to the reaction mixture. Also under anhydrous conditions the enzyme requires some minimum amount of water for its optimum activity. Thus, 2% (w/w of oil) water was also added to the reaction mixture. Under these optimized conditions, EPROS of TLL (28&#160;U/g of oil) bioimprinted with OG or CTAB was able to give a 99% conversion to biodiesel within 4&#160;h (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) whereas non-imprinted EPROS yielded only 82% of the fatty acid methyl esters.</p>
