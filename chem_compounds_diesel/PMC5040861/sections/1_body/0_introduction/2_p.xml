<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As a short term measure, use of biodiesel blends with diesel appears to be a good option among encouraging the switch over to alternative fuels in general and biofuels in particular <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. One major worry has been that without tax breaks, replacing diesel with biodiesel blends is not possible <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. At present, biodiesel blends sold at petrol pumps in various countries is made by chemical catalyst route. There is a huge gap between the cost of chemical catalysts and lipases which can be utilized as the greener choice as a catalyst <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Nevertheless, from the view point of development of a more sustainable process, switch over to the lipase catalysed route is very attractive. Hence, it is not surprising that interest in these enzyme catalysed processes has continued over the last few decades. A pilot plant for production of biodiesel in China which uses a lipase has been running for several years <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Some more are being established <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Obviously, any innovation which can reduce the cost of enzyme in this production process would facilitate further adoption of this green route at a commercial level.</p>
