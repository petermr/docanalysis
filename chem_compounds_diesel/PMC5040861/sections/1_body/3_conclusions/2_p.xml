<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Oils/fats are renewable resources and hence ideally suited to obtain a biofuel. Hence, the biodiesel or biodiesel blends have evoked considerable interest in the last few decades <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In the present work, we have shown that an inexpensive lipase from <italic>Thermomyces lanuginosus</italic> could be converted into a biocatalyst preparation with highly enhanced catalytic efficiency by a simple inexpensive strategy of dual bioimprinting. We also use the solvent free approach, that is, no organic solvent was used and oil itself was used as the reaction medium. The strategy should apparently work equally well with any oil/fat as a feedstock.</p>
