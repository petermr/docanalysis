<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The enzyme precipitated and rinsed with organic solvents (EPROS) were prepared as follows: The lipase (TLL: 100&#160;&#956;L) was dissolved in the 200&#160;mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (1&#160;mL) containing various surfactants wherever mentioned. They were vortexed for two minutes and then precipitated in the suitable organic solvents (4&#160;mL) at 4&#160;&#176;C and with shaking at 200&#160;rpm for 30&#160;min. The precipitates were then centrifuged at 1000<italic>g</italic> for 5&#160;min. The supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was washed twice with the chilled precipitating solvent followed by three washes with chilled <italic>n</italic>-propanol to remove the surfactant wherever used as all the surfactants used had high solubility in alcohol. A final wash with chilled ethanol was also given. The EPROS were then used for further studies.</p>
