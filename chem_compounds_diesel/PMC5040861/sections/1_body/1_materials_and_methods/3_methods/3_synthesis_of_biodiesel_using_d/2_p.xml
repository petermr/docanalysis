Optimum amount of water and silica (w/w of the oil) was added to the reaction mixture. The lipase preparation was added to this and incubated at the optimum temperature (40&#160;&#176;C) with a constant shaking at 200&#160;rpm. Reactions were carried out in duplicate, and the yields between duplicates were found to be within 3%. The progress of reaction was monitored by taking aliquots (40&#160;&#956;L) from the reaction mixture at different time intervals and analysed by gas chromatography.</p>
