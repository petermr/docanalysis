However, mixing/blending of two or more oils as a feedstock for biodiesel production could produce a low viscous fuel suitable for the engine. This study produced a novel heterogeneous base catalyst from waste wood ash (WWA) and applied it to synthesis of biodiesel from <i>Annona muricata</i> and <i>Calophyllum inophyllum</i> oilseed blend. The production route was via a two-step process due to the high free fatty acid of the blended oil. Process optimization of the transesterification step was carried out via response surface methodology (RSM). The strength of the developed catalyst was tested through catalyst regeneration and recyclability. The quality of the biodiesel was compared with biodiesel recommended standard.\u2022Waste wood ash contained a high percentage of calcium carbonate\u2022Blended oil produced oil of low viscosity\u2022Two-step production route was used for biodiesel synthesis\u2022Process optimization via hybrid design produced optimum biodiesel yield.", "affiliation": "Akwa Ibom State University, Ikot Akpaden, Mkpat Enin L.G.A, Nigeria.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Optimization", "Physicochemical properties", "blending", "biodiesel", "Heterogeneous Catalyst"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2020.101188"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8374236"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8374236?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-08-26", "firstIndexDate": "2021-08-27", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-08-26", "dateOfRevision": "2021-08-27", "electronicPublicationDate": "2020-12-23", "firstPublicationDate": "2020-12-23"}
