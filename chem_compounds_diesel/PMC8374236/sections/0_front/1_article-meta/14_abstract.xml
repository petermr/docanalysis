<abstract xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="abs0002"><p>Naturally, biodiesel synthesized from highly viscous and high-density vegetable oil is usually unsuitable as fuel in the internal combustion engine. However, mixing/blending of two or more oils as a feedstock for biodiesel production could produce a low viscous fuel suitable for the engine. This study produced a novel heterogeneous base catalyst from waste wood ash (WWA) and applied it to synthesis of biodiesel from <italic>Annona muricata</italic> and <italic>Calophyllum inophyllum</italic> oilseed blend. The production route was via a two-step process due to the high free fatty acid of the blended oil. Process optimization of the transesterification step was carried out via response surface methodology (RSM). The strength of the developed catalyst was tested through catalyst regeneration and recyclability. The quality of the biodiesel was compared with biodiesel recommended standard.<list list-type="simple" id="celist0002"><list-item id="celistitem0005"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="para0005">Waste wood ash contained a high percentage of calcium carbonate</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0006"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="para0006">Blended oil produced oil of low viscosity</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0007"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="para0007">Two-step production route was used for biodiesel synthesis</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0008"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="para0008">Process optimization via hybrid design produced optimum biodiesel yield.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract>
