The CWWA was recycled at the end reaction, because of the impurity at the surface of the regenerated catalyst; the washing with alcohol to remove impurity was carried out before being centrifuged at 4000&#160;rpm for 25&#160;min, and then filtered to obtain wet CWWA. The wet CWWA was then oven-dried at 150&#160;&#176;C for 120&#160;min, allowed to cool at room temperature before reusing. The degeneration in catalyst strength was established by graphical plot, with a reduction in 5th and 6th cycles. Henceforward, the catalyst reusability test was stopped at the 4th cycle (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;5</xref>).<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Reusability test plot.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0005">Fig 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p>
