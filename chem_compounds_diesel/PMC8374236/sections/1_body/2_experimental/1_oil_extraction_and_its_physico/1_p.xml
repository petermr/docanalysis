<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0017">Oil was extracted from the cleaned milled seed powder of <italic>Annona muricata</italic> and <italic>Calophyllum inophyllum</italic> using a soxhlet extractor with n-hexane as solvent. The reaction temperature was set at the range of the boiling point of n-hexane, and the reaction time was maintained at 70&#160;min for complete oil extraction from the two powders. The excess n-hexane in the oil was recycled and reused, while the residual cake was used as an animal feed supplement. The physicochemical properties of the two oils were determined to ascertain the suitability of the oil for biodiesel synthesis.</p>
