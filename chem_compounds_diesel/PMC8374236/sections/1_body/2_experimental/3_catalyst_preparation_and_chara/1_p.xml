The unwanted particles were removed by decantation, while the pure wetted waste wood ash (PWWWA) was obtained through filtration. The filtrate was discarded, and the residual PWWWA was oven-dried at 110&#160;&#176;C in an oven until a constant weight is achieved. The dried WWA was calcined in a programmable muffle furnace at 1100&#160;&#176;C for 3&#160;h, the calcined waste wood ash (CWWA) was allowed to cool to room temperature for 48&#160;h, before characterization.</p>
