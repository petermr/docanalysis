Blend oil physicochemical properties were determined through AOAC, 1997 <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> standard methods, catalyst characterization of WWA were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), BET isothermal adsorption, and Hammett indicators. The quality of the biodiesel was ascertained by comparing it with biodiesel standard (ASTM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="astm:D6551" id="interref0002">D6551</ext-link>
