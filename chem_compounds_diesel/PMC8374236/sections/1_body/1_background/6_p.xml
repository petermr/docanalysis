<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0015">Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is an optimization software package for variable optimization of complex processes that helps to understand the interaction of the variables, produce several experimental runs, determine the level of significance, and predict the optimum conversion of the output. This software has been reported to apply to biodiesel synthesis from various oil feedstocks <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13</xref>,<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21]</xref>. The software is capable of handling design related factors such as Central Composite Design (CCD), Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD), Box Behnken Design (BBD), Pentagon, Hexagon, <sc>d</sc>-Optimal, Distance-based, Modified Distance, 3 -Level Factorial, Hybrid, One-Factor, User Design, and Historical Data. When dealing with four process variable factor with three/five levels, only CCD and Hybrid design can be exploited. Since CCD can give a higher number of experimental runs (30) with repetition runs, presence of lack of fit, and give room for outliers, Hybrid design (HD) is preferable to overcome the CCD drawback. HD can easily produce 16 runs with no lack of fit, no repetition, and does not give room for outliers.</p>
