The oil could be edible or non-edible oil, depending on the acid value of the oil. Oil can be classified as edible if the acid value of the oil is less than 3.00&#160;mg KOH/g oil (%FFA &lt; 1.5), and can successively undergo transesterification reaction with a base, while the non-edible oil acid value must be greater than 3&#160;mg KOH/g oil (%FFA &#8805; 1.5), which required acid esterification (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/HCl) before transesterification with base.</p>
