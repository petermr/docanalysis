Researchers have revealed that the major components of the waste wood ash are calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, some find no carbonate but calcium oxide (CaO) <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, some show the presence of about 12% iron oxide due to soil contamination while some show none <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, because of its availability, environmental pollution effects, non-weather resistance, unsuitability for polishing, and brittle structure, it is considered as base-feedstock for biodiesel synthesis from seed oil.</p>
