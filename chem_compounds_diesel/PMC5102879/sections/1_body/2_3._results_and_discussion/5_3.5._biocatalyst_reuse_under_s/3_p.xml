This biocatalyst showed higher stability under microwave irradiation compared to conventional heating in the methyl ester production from soybean oil [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Yu et al. [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] also demonstrated good stability and the possibility of recycling of Novozym 435 during microwave-assisted resolution of (<italic>R,S</italic>)-2-octanol with vinyl acetate by enzymatic transesterification. A slight decrease (8%) in enzyme activity was observed under microwave irradiation after five reuses. However, only 70% of the original activity of the biocatalyst was recovered under conventional heating after five reuses.</p>
