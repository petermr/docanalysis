<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The operational stability of the selected biocatalyst (immobilized lipase PS) was determined in consecutive transesterification batch runs carried out under conventional heating (24&#8201;h at 45&#176;C) and microwave irradiations (6&#8201;h at 45&#176;C). Transesterification activity was determined by the formation of ethyl esters at the end of each recycle process as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(a)</xref>, taking the activity attained in the first run as 100%.</p>
