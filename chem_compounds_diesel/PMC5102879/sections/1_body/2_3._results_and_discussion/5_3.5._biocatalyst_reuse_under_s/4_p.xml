<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Deleterious effects of microwave irradiation on the operational stability of immobilized enzymes are still scarce in the literature. Some insight into the reason for lower operational stability under microwave irradiation may be gained by considering the medium polarity. Microwave irradiation exerts a strong selective heating by highly polar compounds (e.g., short-chain alcohols) due to their low log&#8201;<italic>P</italic> values and high dielectric constant that affect the dipole molecular rotation and ion induction of these compounds, thus improving the energy transfer in the reaction mixture [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In this study, transesterification reaction was carried out using excess of ethanol (molar ratio oil to ethanol of 1&#8201;:&#8201;9). Thus, a strong energy transfer and heating of nonreacted ethanol molecules could increase the interaction with the essential hydration layer surrounding the enzyme structure, thus leading to possible distortion of its active conformation. Moreover, microwave irradiation could also accelerate desorption of noncovalent enzyme molecules from the support surface after successive cycles of reaction.</p>
