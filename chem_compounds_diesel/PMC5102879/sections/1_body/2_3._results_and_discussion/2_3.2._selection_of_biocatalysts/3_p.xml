<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">According to results summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>, ethyl esters from palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), and linoleic (C18:2) acids were the main esters produced in the reaction. Among the tested biocatalysts, immobilized lipase M, lipase A, and Piccantase R8000 displayed the lowest catalytic activities, rendering maximum FAEE yield of 1.8, 2.3, and 4.1%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, kinematic viscosity values for these samples were almost identical to the crude oil. The reaction catalyzed by immobilized lipase L036P and porcine pancreatic attained similar FAEE yields (around 9%) and kinematic viscosities (25.9&#8211;27.5&#8201;mm<sup>2</sup>/s). However, these biocatalysts displayed different specificities because porcine pancreatic exhibited higher affinity towards palmitic acid (C16:0), while lipase L036P showed higher affinity for stearic acid (C18:0).</p>
