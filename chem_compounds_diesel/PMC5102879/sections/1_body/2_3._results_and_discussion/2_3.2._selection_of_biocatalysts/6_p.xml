<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Viscosity is an important property of biodiesel since it affects the fluidity of the fuel and the operation of fuel injection equipment. High viscosity leads to poor atomization of the fuel spray and less accurate operation of fuel injectors [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2</xref> shows the correlation between the FAEE yield and the kinematic viscosity reduction as a function of time for the reaction catalyzed by the immobilized Lipase PS, the most active prepared biocatalyst in this study. As can be observed, consistent reduction of the kinematic viscosity value from 35.4 to 5.1&#8201;mm<sup>2</sup>/s was attained as the FAEE yield increased, which is in accordance with specifications recommended by the ASTM for biodiesel (methyl and ethyl esters) (method ASTM D6751). Similar behavior was described in previous studies for the enzymatic synthesis of ethyl esters from several feedstocks [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
