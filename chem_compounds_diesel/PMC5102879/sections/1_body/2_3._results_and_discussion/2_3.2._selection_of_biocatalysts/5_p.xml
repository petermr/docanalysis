<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A comparison between the reaction performances by the two most active biocatalysts (immobilized lipases AK and PS) and Novozym 435 is displayed in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref> in terms of ethyl esters concentration (% wt) formed as a function of time. Maximum ethyl ester concentration of all lipases was reached at 72&#8201;h of reaction. However, immobilized lipase PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>) was slightly more active than immobilized lipase AK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>) and presented similar performance compared to the commercial biocatalyst (Novozym 435) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). These results could be attributed to good diffusion of substrate molecules from the reaction mixture to the microenvironment of the prepared biocatalyst with lipase PS. Moreover, the kinematic viscosity for the purified samples from the reaction catalyzed by immobilized lipase PS and Novozym 435 is in agreement with specifications recommended by the ASTM D6751 for biodiesel (methyl and ethyl esters), which states that the kinematic viscosity of biodiesel (B100) must be in the range between 1.9 and 6.0&#8201;mm<sup>2</sup>/s. On the other hand, the kinematic viscosity of ethyl esters synthetized using immobilized Lipase AK was 6.72&#8201;mm<sup>2</sup>/s due to incomplete conversion of the oil into ethyl esters (FAEE yield of 91.1%).</p>
