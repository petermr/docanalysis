<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Lipase L036P presented the maximum hydrolytic activity (45112.4 &#177; 907.7&#8201;IU/g of crude extract), followed by lipase M (40875.4 &#177; 1220.8&#8201;IU/g of crude extract). The hydrolytic activities of lipase PS and lipase AK were, respectively, 30422.8 &#177; 1044.5 and 29878.5 &#177; 890.6&#8201;IU/g of crude extract. Among the tested biocatalysts, lipase A, porcine pancreatic, and Piccantase R8000 were the less active biocatalysts in the hydrolysis of olive oil emulsion. Although both lipase L036P and Piccantase R8000 are lipase preparations from<italic> R. oryzae</italic>, the latter presented higher protein concentration, as above described, and hydrolytic activity around 3.26-fold lower than lipase L036P. These different features could be attributed to different cultivation conditions and inducers used in the production of each lipase preparation that strongly influence their catalytic properties, including the production of isoenzymes and glycosylation degree [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, different additives and stabilizing agents present in their formulations such as salts, polyols, or sugars and purification degree could also influence their catalytic properties [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
