<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The specific activity for each lipase preparation (crude extract) was also determined, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. This parameter is more interesting due to the low purity of commercial lipase preparations and the specific activity allows a real and effective comparison among enzymatic activities towards a given substrate [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although lipase PS and lipase AK have presented the lowest protein concentrations, these two lipase preparations exhibited higher specific activity values than those of the other preparations, 5416.7 &#177; 102.6 and 2133.9 &#177; 87.5&#8201;IU/mg of protein, respectively. Specific activity values for lipase A, lipase M, lipase L036P, Piccantase R8000, and porcine pancreatic varied from 104.2 &#177; 7.3 to 484.1 &#177; 21.9&#8201;IU/mg of protein. The results showed that specific activity follows the series lipase PS &gt; lipase AK &gt; lipase L036P &gt; lipase M &gt; lipase A &gt; porcine pancreatic &gt; Piccantase R8000.</p>
