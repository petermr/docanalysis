<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> Seven commercial lipase preparations were used as biocatalysts and their catalytic properties were determined in terms of protein concentration, hydrolytic activity, and specific activity (ratio between the hydrolytic activity and protein concentration). According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>, Piccantase R8000, porcine pancreatic, and lipase M presented the highest protein concentration, followed by lipase A and lipase L036P. Among them, lipase PS and lipase AK exhibited the lowest protein concentrations, 13.0 &#177; 0.3 and 14.2 &#177; 0.4&#8201;mg/g of crude extract, respectively.</p>
