<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The hydrolytic and specific activity values of the prepared biocatalysts were also determined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). The hydrolytic activity of the immobilized lipases ranged from 749.1 &#177; 51.7&#8201;IU/g of support (immobilized Piccantase R8000) to 2925.4 &#177; 100.8&#8201;IU/g of support (immobilized lipase L036P) and shows different behavior of each lipase preparation for the support epoxy-SiO<sub>2</sub>-PVA. The immobilization of lipase PS and lipase AK yielded also biocatalysts with high hydrolytic activity, 1980.6 &#177; 88.4&#8201;IU/g and 1860.3 &#177; 94.5&#8201;IU/g, respectively. These biocatalysts were strongly more active than those ones prepared by immobilizing lipase M, porcine pancreatic, lipase A, and Piccantase R8000.</p>
