These results suggest that upon immobilization the support surface promoted a strong distortion on the three-dimensional structure of lipases or bad orientation on the support surface that restricted the access of olive oil molecules to their active sites. These results could be also attributed to the different additives and stabilizing agents present in each formulation. These additives have been used to protect the enzyme from external denaturing agents by providing additional sites for hydrogen bonding with the enzyme surface that decreases dehydration and distortion of its three-dimensional structure [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, these additives can interact with nucleophilic groups in the enzyme structure (e.g., &#8211;NH<sub>2</sub> and &#8211;OH) that influence the orientation of enzyme molecules on the support surface [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Similar results were reported in previous studies carried out in our lab concerning the immobilization of<italic> Thermomyces lanuginosus</italic> lipase from different commercial formulations supplied by Novozymes (Lipolase&#174; and Lipex&#174; 100&#8201;L) by different protocols on activated organic supports (glyoxyl-agarose and epoxy-chitosan/alginate beads) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
