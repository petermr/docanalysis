It is possible to verify in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the appearance of the signal a quartet at 4.1&#8201;ppm, referring to the protons of the ethylene group from the alcohol portion of ester [CH<sub>3</sub>&#8211;CH<sub>2</sub>&#8211;O&#8211;(C=O)&#8211;R] and the absence of signals corresponding to the hydrogen atoms of the CH<sub>2</sub> group of the glycerol at 4.2&#8201;ppm [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. With these results, the equation validated by Paiva et al. [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] was tested for the operating conditions of this study, obtaining a correlation coefficient of 0.994 and 98.5% conversion of Jatropha oil into ethyl esters. From these data, it was possible to demonstrate the efficiency of the enzymatic route for the synthesis of biodiesel from Jatropha oil, as well as the quality of the product obtained as fuel in terms of thermal stability, purity, and fluidity.</p>
