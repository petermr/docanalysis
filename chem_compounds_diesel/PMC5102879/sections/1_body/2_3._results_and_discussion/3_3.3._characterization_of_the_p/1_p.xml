<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out to compare the thermal stability of Jatropha oil and ethyl esters (biodiesel). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3(a)</xref> shows the TG curves in inert atmosphere for oil and biodiesel obtained from the transesterification reaction catalyzed by immobilized lipase PS. Jatropha oil was thermally stable up to 321&#176;C, thus showing its high thermal stability. TG curve showed two stages of thermal degradation between 321&#8211;441.7&#176;C and 441.7&#8211;499.6&#176;C, with 81.6 and 18.4% of mass loss, respectively, corresponding with the volatilization of fatty acids contained in Jatropha oil. On the other hand, biodiesel showed just one step of thermal degradation between 128 and 290&#176;C with higher decomposition rate at 258&#176;C. The loss of mass in the order of 98% was also attributed to volatilization of ethyl esters.</p>
