<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Thermogravimetric analysis was also performed to evaluate the oxidative stability of biodiesel from Jatropha oil since poor oxidative stability is one of the major issues that limit the use of biodiesel as a fuel in compression ignition engines [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3(b)</xref> shows the TG/DTG curves obtained for the biodiesel sample in an oxidative atmosphere. As can be observed, the mass of the biodiesel starts to decrease at approximately 140&#176;C and it continues until all the ethyl esters present in the sample were vaporized. The relative mass lost was around 95%. Biodiesel from Jatropha oil had lower oxidative stability than those ones from beef tallow (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>initial</sub> = 187&#176;C), Babassu oil (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>initial</sub> = 154&#176;C), and palm oil (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>initial</sub> = 144&#176;C) [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This result was expected due to its higher percentage of linoleic acid (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) that is prone to oxidative degradation. Similar behavior was reported for other polyunsaturated biodiesel from safflower, soybean, linseed, and sunflower oils [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Oxidation stability can be improved by antioxidant additives or blending with more oxidatively stable biodiesel [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
