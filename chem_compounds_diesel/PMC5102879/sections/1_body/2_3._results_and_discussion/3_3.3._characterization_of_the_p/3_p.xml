<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The quality of the purified biodiesel was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The infrared spectrum shows the ester C=O axial deformation at 1738&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, as well as two bands related to the ester C&#8211;O axial deformation at 1243 and 1179&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The bands between 2924 and 2855&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> correspond to the vibration of symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching of C&#8211;H methyl and methylene groups. A weak signal at 3007&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is due to the olefinic group (=CH&#8211;) which indicates the presence of unsaturated fatty acids in ethyl esters. The spectrum shows that the produced biodiesel did not display the characteristic band at around 3300&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>related to the primary alcohol O&#8211;H axial deformation. These results suggest absence of residual glycerol or ethanol molecules, thus showing that the step of biodiesel purification was very efficient and simple.</p>
