<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The CN is a measurement of the combustion quality during ignition of biodiesel and depends on the distribution of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids or esters. The ignition quality is associated with the interval of ignition. A fuel with high CN number has a short ignition interval and starts to burn shortly after it is injected into an engine. In this study, CN value was estimated at 53.0. This value is in compliance with the standards for biodiesel (ASTM D6751), which recommend a minimum CN of 47 [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The long chain saturated factor is used to calculate the cold filter plugging point (CFPP), which is based on the amount of long chain saturated fatty acids (from C16:0) in the oil. The CFPP value is related to the minimum temperature at which the biodiesel can generate clogging and problems in the motor. The biodiesel provided a CFPP value of 9.28&#176;C. This value is lower compared with methyl esters (biodiesel) from palm and peanut oils, whose CFPP values are 10 and 17&#176;C, respectively [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Concerning the oxidative stability, the predicted value (5.87&#8201;h) is outside the minimum required by the standard requirements (6.0&#8201;h at 110&#176;C) though it has better stability than soybean biodiesel since the content of polyunsaturated ethyl esters (C18:2) is balanced with similar monounsaturated content (18:1) which is considered to have lower suitability to be degraded. From the comparison standpoint, our results had some characteristics similar to biodiesel samples obtained from other feedstocks [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition, the results described here are in close agreement with those reported by Giakoumis [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], in which a detailed statistical investigation was conducted to assess the average values of all properties of the most investigated biodiesel, including biodiesel from Jatropha oil.</p>
