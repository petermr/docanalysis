<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It is known that microwave heating involves directed absorption of energy by functional groups that bear ionic conductivity or a dipole rotational effect, and this energy was then released into the surrounding solution [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In the reaction medium, ethanol is a good microwave radiation absorption material [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which would destroy the two-tier structure of the interface between ethanol and oil, making the functional groups much more highly reactive [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Microwave irradiation can also induce conformation changes in the lipase structure that facilitates the access of substrate molecules to the active sites and, consequently, the enzyme behaves slightly differently and may become more active [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
