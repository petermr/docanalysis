Under conventional heating, a full conversion into ethyl esters was achieved at 72&#8201;h (productivity of 45&#8201;mg biodiesel/g&#183;h), while the reaction reached equilibrium in 24&#8201;h using microwave heating with the same yield, corresponding to productivity of 121.4&#8201;mg biodiesel/g&#183;h. This indicates that to achieve the same yield of ethyl esters yield percentage, shorter reaction time was needed under microwave irradiation compared to the conventional heating. Moreover, the reaction rate was improved up to 3-fold in the first 4&#8201;h of reaction compared to conventional heating.</p>
