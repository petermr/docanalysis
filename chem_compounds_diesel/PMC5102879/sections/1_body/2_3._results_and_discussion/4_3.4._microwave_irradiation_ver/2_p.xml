In another study, the enzymatic synthesis of isoamyl myristate by esterification reaction in a solvent-free system catalyzed by Novozym 435 was also improved by microwave irradiation [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The productivity of xylitol monoesters synthesis catalyzed by immobilized lipase from<italic> Penicillium camemberti </italic>was higher under nonconventional heating than conventional one, 5.3&#8201;mmol/h and 2.2&#8201;mmol/h, respectively [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
