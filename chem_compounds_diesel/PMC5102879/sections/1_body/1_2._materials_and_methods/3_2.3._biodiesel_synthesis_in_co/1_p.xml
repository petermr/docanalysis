<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The reactions were carried out in a jacketed cylindrical glass reactor (6&#8201;mm high &#215; 4&#8201;mm internal diameter and 50&#8201;mL capacity, coupled with a reflux condenser) containing 15&#8201;g of substrate consisting of Jatropha oil to ethanol at molar ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;9 in a solvent-free system. The mixtures were incubated with the prepared biocatalysts at fixed proportion of 500&#8201;IU per gram of oil under agitation (200&#8201;rpm) at 45&#176;C for a maximum period of 72&#8201;h. The reaction progress was monitored by taking samples at various time intervals and the ethyl esters formed were analyzed using a gas chromatography (Varian CG 3800, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) with FID detection and a 5% DEGS CHR-WHP 80/100 mesh 6&#8201;ft 2.0&#8201;mm ID and 1/800 OD column (Restek Frankel Commerce of Analytic Instruments Ltd., SP, Brazil) following previous established conditions [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
