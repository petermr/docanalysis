<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Epoxy-silica-PVA composite was prepared by the hydrolysis and polycondensation of tetraethoxysilane, following activation with epichlorohydrin according to the methodology previously described [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Before immobilization, the protein concentrations [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and hydrolytic activities [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] of all lipase preparations were determined. The immobilization of the lipases was performed at a ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 gram of crude enzyme per gram of support using hexane as a dispersion medium in the presence of PEG-1500 (100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>L/g of support). Lipase-support systems were kept in contact for 16&#8201;h at 4&#176;C under static conditions and then the biocatalysts were filtered (nylon membrane 62HD from Scheiz Seidengaze-fabrik AG, Thal Schweiz, Switzerland) and thoroughly rinsed with hexane. The hydrolytic activity of lipase preparations was assayed by the olive oil emulsion method [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One international unit (IU) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates 1 <italic>&#956;</italic>mol of free fatty acid per min under the assay conditions (37&#176;C, pH 7.0). Specific activity was calculated after determining the activity of the immobilized enzyme (apparent hydrolytic activity) and comparing with the immobilized protein (IP) concentration. In this study, immobilization yield &#8776;100% for all immobilization procedures was observed.</p>
