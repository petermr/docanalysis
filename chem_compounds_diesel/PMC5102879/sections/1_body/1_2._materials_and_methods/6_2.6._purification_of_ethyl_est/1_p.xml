The liquid phase was transferred into decanting funnel in which the same amount of distilled water was added. Then, vigorous stirring was carried out and the mixture was allowed to stand for 6&#8201;h, for phase separation. This procedure was performed three times, in sequence. The superior phase, consisting of fatty acid ethyl esters (biodiesel), was evaporated in a rotatory evaporator. Subsequently, the solution was dried sodium sulfate and the lower phase, consisting of glycerol and wastewater, was discharged.</p>
