<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy was carried out on a Varian Mercury spectrometer operating at 300&#8201;MHz. The samples (around 120&#8201;mg) were dissolved in 0.6&#8201;mL of CDCl<sub>3</sub> that contained 0.03% tetramethylsilane, and the resulting solutions were placed in a 5&#8201;mm diameter NMR tube. The kinematic viscosity of purified ethyl esters was determined by Brookfield Viscometers model LVDVII (Brookfield Viscometers Ltd., UK) using the cone CP 42. Thermogravimetry (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves for Jatropha oil and ethyl esters (biodiesel) were recorded using a thermal balance (Shimadzu TGA-50, Thermogravimetric Analyzer). A dynamic method was used, at a heating rate of 10&#176;C/min. The initial sample mass was 10.00 &#177; 0.5&#8201;mg, in both inert (nitrogen) and oxidative (synthetic air) atmospheres with a flow rate of 50&#8201;mL/min, in the 25&#8211;1000&#176;C temperature range [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. FT-IR analysis was used in order to confirm the purity of biodiesel sample. The IR spectrum was recorded in a Perkin Elmer Spectrum GX spectrometer using KBr pellets in the range of 4000&#8211;400&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p>
