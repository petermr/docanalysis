<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The reactions were carried out in a microwave reactor (Model Discover, CEM Corporation) consisting of a cylindrical internal chamber with 75&#8201;mm diameter and 100&#8201;mm height. The temperature of the reaction was monitored by an infrared sensor located in the lower part of the chamber. ChemDriver software was used to record data for each run, including variation in the microwave flux and temperature evolution. The working volume was a 100&#8201;mL glass reactor containing 12&#8201;g of substrate consisting of Jatropha oil to ethanol at molar ratio oil to ethanol of 1&#8201;:&#8201;9 in a solvent-free system. The reactor was coupled with a reflux condenser to avoid ethanol loss. The mixture was also incubated with immobilized lipase at proportion of 500&#8201;IU per gram of oil at 45&#176;C for a maximum period of 24&#8201;h. Ethyl esters formed were determined by GC analysis [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and the FAEE yield (%) was defined as the ratio between the produced and theoretical esters concentrations. The productivity (mg/g&#183;h) was calculated by dividing the ethyl esters concentration at a given time <italic>t</italic>.</p>
