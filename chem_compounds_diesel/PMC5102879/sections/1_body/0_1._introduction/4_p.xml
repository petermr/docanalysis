<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Lipases (triacylglycerol acyl hydrolases EC 3.1.1.3) are hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols into free fatty acids and glycerol, but they can also catalyze esterification, transesterification, and interesterification in nonaqueous media [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The limitations of the industrial application of lipases have mainly been due to their high cost. Immobilization facilitates the separation of products and provides more flexibility with enzyme/substrate contact using various reactor configurations [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, immobilization on solid supports may improve enzyme features, from stability to selectivity. The immobilization of lipases by several techniques on solid supports is a well-documented technology that allows application of these enzymes in several industrial processes, including biodiesel synthesis [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lipases have been immobilized using different protocols as physical adsorption on hydrophobic and ionic exchange resins, covalent attachment on highly activated supports, and encapsulation in organic matrices [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Covalent attachment of nucleophilic groups of lipases (N-terminal and hydroxyl groups) on highly activated supports (e.g., epoxy or aldehyde groups on the support surface introduced after the activation step) may promote the stabilization of their three-dimensional structures, thus reducing possible conformational changes induced by any distorting agents such as solvents and temperature [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Previous studies carried out in our lab have reported the preparation of robust biocatalysts prepared by covalent attachment of several lipases on activated hybrid support SiO<sub>2</sub>-PVA for further application in biotransformation reactions [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
