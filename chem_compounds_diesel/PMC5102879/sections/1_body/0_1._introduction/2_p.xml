<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Recent studies have focused on the application of nonedible oils for biodiesel production such as wastes and several plant oils, including from<italic> Jatropha curcas</italic> L. Its oil has been considered one of the most promising feedstocks for biodiesel production due to its high oil content, ranging from 30% to 50% based on seed dry mass [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, Jatropha trees can grow on wasteland with minimum water and fertilizer demand [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, its application as feedstock presents some disadvantages such as high toxicity of their seeds and leaves to human beings and animals because the presence of toxic compounds such as curcin and phorbol esters limits its application in food industries and competition with food production for land use and the plant does not produce high amounts of seed oils unless it is well cultivated [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
