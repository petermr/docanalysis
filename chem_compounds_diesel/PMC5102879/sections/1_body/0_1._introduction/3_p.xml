<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The traditional route of biodiesel synthesis is the transesterification of oils and fats from several sources with short-chain alcohols such as methanol and ethanol [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For industrial biodiesel, homogeneous alkali catalysts such as potassium and sodium hydroxides, as well as potassium and sodium alkoxides, have been preferentially used [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The application of acid catalysts has also been reported, but this process is slower than the alkali catalyzed process [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Acid catalyzed reactions are more feasible for the esterification and transesterification of oils and fats containing high free fatty acid content [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, there are major drawbacks of conventional chemical processes, as several problems during the steps of removal of catalyst from the product and the wastewater treatment, and excessive consumption of energy [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In recent years, heterogeneous catalysts, including immobilized lipases, have gained much attention because they can be easily separated from the system at the end of the reaction and may also be reused. Besides, the use of these catalysts does not produce soaps by free fatty acid neutralization or triacylglycerol saponification [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
