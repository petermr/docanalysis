<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Biodiesel, defined as monoalkyl esters of fatty acids derived from several oils and fats, has gained attention as a source of alternative fuel due to their important features such as biodegradability, nontoxicity, low emission of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and unburned hydrocarbons [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The global production of biodiesel was worth nearly 22.5 billion liters in 2012 [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], with a projection around 41.9 billion liters in 2020 [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Biodiesel has been broadly produced using edible oils as feedstocks such as those from rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, and palm, thus leading to a conflict with food supply [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several plant oils, animal fats, microalgal oils, and waste oils (animal rendering, fish processing waste, and cooking oils) have been proposed as potential feedstocks for biodiesel production [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On an industrial scale, biodiesel has been preferentially synthesized from methanol [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the last years, the application of ethanol as a sustainable reactant has gained significant attention in industrial processes due to its high production and low cost in Brazil [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
