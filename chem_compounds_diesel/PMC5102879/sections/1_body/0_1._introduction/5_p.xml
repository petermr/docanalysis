<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The aim of this study was the selection of immobilized lipases from several sources via covalent attachment on epoxy-SiO<sub>2</sub>-PVA particles to catalyze biodiesel synthesis (ethyl esters) by transesterification reaction of Jatropha oil in a solvent-free system. The results were compared with commercially available Novozym 435, the most used immobilized lipase in biotransformation reactions which is prepared by immobilizing CALB via physical adsorption on macroporous poly(methyl methacrylate-<italic>co</italic>-divinylbenzene) particles (Lewatit VP OC 1600) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The most active biocatalyst was then selected for subsequent studies concerning the characterization of purified product by several techniques. Moreover, experiments were also carried out to determine the feasibility of using nonconventional heating systems such as microwave irradiation. Microwave, a nonionizing radiation has been explored in recent years as an alternative heating system in many areas, including the enzymatic biodiesel synthesis [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Microwave heating involves directed absorption of energy by functional groups that bear ionic conductivity or a dipole rotational effect, and this energy is then released into the surrounding solution [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, seven biocatalysts were prepared via covalent attachment on epoxy-SiO<sub>2</sub>-PVA. Their catalytic properties were determined in hydrolysis and transesterification reactions. The results were compared with a commercial biocatalyst, Novozym 435. The application of these different biocatalysts in biodiesel production by transesterification with ethanol in a solvent-free system has not been reported in the literature yet.</p>
