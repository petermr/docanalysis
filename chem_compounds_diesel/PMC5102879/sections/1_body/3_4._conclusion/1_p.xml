<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The immobilization of several lipases via covalent attachment on epoxy-SiO<sub>2</sub>-PVA composite allowed the preparation of biocatalysts with different activities in hydrolysis and transesterification reactions. Among them, immobilized lipase from<italic> Rhizopus oryzae</italic> (L036P) was the biocatalyst with the highest hydrolytic activity. On the other hand, immobilized lipase PS and lipase AK were the most active biocatalysts for biodiesel synthesis. The promising performance of immobilized lipase PS was confirmed by TGA, FT-IR, and <sup>1</sup>H NMR analyses indicating the occurrence of the transesterification reaction, by the corresponding thermal degradation of ethyl esters and the presence of bands related to formation of ester bonds and high purity. Additional experiments were carried out under microwave irradiation and the results suggested that the microwave heating constitutes a potential procedure to enhance the reaction rate by reducing the total reaction time. However, the immobilized lipase showed lower half-life time when subjected to consecutive bath runs under microwave irradiation, probably, that under these conditions the enzyme desorption from the support surface was more intense than conventional heating. These results clearly show the potential application of the selected biocatalyst to synthesize biodiesel in a solvent-free system.</p>
